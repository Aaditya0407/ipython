8692635	everyone,i have a lot of files write to disk per seconds,i want to disable disk cache to improve performance,i google search find a solution:win32 CreateFile method with FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING and How to empty/flush Windows READ disk cache in C#?.i write a little of code to test whether can worked:when running this program,the application get exception:IO operation will not work. Most likely the file will become too long or the handle was not opened to support synchronous IO operationslater,i found this article When you create an object with constraints, you have to make sure everybody who uses the object understands those constraints,but i can't fully understand,so i change my code to test:it's running ok,but i just want "hello,world" bytes not all.i trying change blocksize to 1 or other integer(not 512 multiple) get same error.i also try win32 WriteFile api also get same error.someone can help me?
8692643	You are not going to improve performance by disabling either disk cache, or buffering. (Which are two entirely different things, by the way.) You are only going to make performance much, much worse.Instead of coming up with a wacky idea as to how to accomplish what you really need to accomplish, and coming to stackoverflow to ask us how to implement your wacky idea, it would be a lot more constructive if you begun by telling us what it is that you are trying to accomplish in the first place.
8692661	CreateFile() function in No Buffering mode imposes strict requirements on what may and what may not be done. Having a buffer of certain size (multiple of device sector size) is one of them. Now, you can improve file writes in this way only if you use buffering in your code. If you want to write 10 bytes without buffering, then No Buffering mode won't help you.
8694551	I want to be able to validate a large quantity of files (a couple of TB) on a semi regular basis via PHP. Security is not an issue and collisions isn't a particularly big one either since it also factors in filesizes. The main goal is to generate the hashes quickly and with as little CPU as possible.My current candidate is md5_file() but was wondering if there is another approach that could be more efficient?
8694565	I think that sha1 could be your best bet, in php you'd use sha1_file
8694567	If efficiency is an issue and security is not, how about simply the binary XOR of the files? Much faster.
8701834	I didn't understand the diffrence between Call-by-name and Call-by-need. As I understood, Call-by-need method restores the answer returned. But how It helps us, and Is there any fundamental difference between the results ?For example,So in call-by-name, as I understood, We will get:and so on. This is because we pass 2*n to e, and e is evaluate with the new i everytime.What would happen in call-by-need?

8710609	Here is my test case : I have a div with overflow:auto, and a div inside it with a margin and a border. The inner div doesn't have its bottom margin in IE8, while it's displayed properly in Webkit and Firefox.
8710682	I removed the height of the .outer div and it worked for me !Propably it doesn't work because your inner div is higher than 100px;
8714955	Ok, I have a horrible hack for you:This works for me but leaves a larger than 5px margin at the bottom of div.outer:JSFiddle: To get past this you could target IE8 only (so not IE8 and below as IE7 works correctly for once) and set margin-bottom to about 1px...but then that is getting even more hacky. The code I have added above should not have any noticeable effect on any other browsers.Extra NoteIf you remove the background-color and check the code in IE9's IE8 compatability mode then it renders fine and the margin-bottom is 5px. However, in my emulator (which is usually quite accurate), the margin-bottom is back to 0 if you do not add background-color.
8719255	I have a variable that a user specifies $start_date in format of y-m-d.so let's say for example $start_date = '2011-10-27';In my database I have a DATETIME field, let's call it sample_date that looks like this2011-10-27 14:15:20When I run sql query using $start_date.. do I have to convert to compare the dates such as or should I convert it somehow first
8719285	Just append some zeros onto this:EDIT: Testing confirms that this is unnecessary. As long as the mysql column is DATETIME formatted, it understands "2010-10-27".HOWEVER! Your example will throw an error, as Greater Than or Equal to should be written ">=", not "=>"
8719320	You don't need to convert the value as long as you've validated the format, but you should definitely sanitize the input to prevent XSS attacks and other nastiness. A calendar drop-down would be good here as well.EDIT:Whoa now... I see you've edited your question and the formats are different. That changes everything! Michael's comment is the correct answer, use strtotime() function to convert the date to a unix timestamp, then recreate the date in the proper format needed... like so... date('Y-m-d', strtotime($start_date))

8740085	I'm working on C++,The following is a function call in C++,What will be the value of argument variable passed to myFunction() call i.e. value assigned before call to the function or value returned from the myFunction() function call.
8740110	Due to temporal necessity, the value of argument before calling myFunction will be passed. This is simply because you don't have the return value yet.The parameters to a function call have to be evaluated before the call. The order of evaluation between parameters is unspecified, but you only have one, so it is evaluated. Whatever it is at that point (before the call) is used, then the function is called. When the function returns, after being run, the return value is assigned to argument.
8740182	Value assigned BEFORE the call will be used inside the function.
8749940	In call by need, we enter the loop, and evaluate the value only once. So In the code above, we will copy (2*n) inside the loop (macro-style) and we will evaluate the expression only one time (Not like call by name). So, in the first iteration we will get e=2. this will be the value of e also in the next iteration, and the output will be:

I have a device that outputs data constantly and I need a php script that can run independent for a browser to load that data into a database should it change.My server is a Linux box and it houses a lot of different development projects so I just have access to one partition of it.The device is actually using a node and python to pull the data and I cam creating a web interface and a logging system for a charting interface I am creating. So it needs to pullt he data at a consistent interval for charting the data I am storing. Thank you all for your fatnastic responses and giving me a lot to work from here. I will look into the solutions offered and see if I can be more specific in my request.
8751433	The minimum timeframe in cron is 1 minute. You need to run the PHP script as some sort of daemon (background process) on the server if you want to process data constantly.A simple, but not very CPU efficient way is to run something like:There is also a PEAR package  for handling things like init.d behavior and logging.

8768485	Question:I use System.Data.OracleClient.System.Data.OracleClient requires OracleInstantClient, which are native dll's.So in order to use System.Data.OracleClient, I need the native dll's installed, or in a folder in the path environment variable.Now, the base problem is, I don't have administrator rights (company laptop - corporate stupidity - not going to change)...So I can neither install anything, nor copy anything in a folder in PATH, nor can I add a folder to the path environment variable, nor can I restart/administer IIS or any other service...So as a test, I just copied oci.dll and oraociei11.dll into the same folder as the WinForms .exe.This worked fine. I was able to access the Oracle database (SELECT * FROM COUNTRIES) without problems.But now, I need to perform the same query in an ASP.NET solution.The problem is, ASP.NET dll's get shadow copied to a temporary folder when they execute.Now to get the dll's to the webapp bin non-the-less, in Global.asax in I overwrote Init with this:in order to copy the native dll's to the supposedly correct location.But I still get DllNotFound Exception...Where or how do I have to put a native dll in a ASP.NET application ?I say again: I cannot set environment variables, and I cannot copy the dlls to a folder that is in path.

8778554	I've got a prewritten function in C that fills an 1-D array with data, e.g.I would like to call the function n times in a row with slightly different parameters (n is dependent on user input), and I need all the data collected in a single C array afterwards. The size of the returned array is not always fixed. Oh, and myFunction does the memory allocation internally. I want to do this in a memory-efficient way, but using realloc in each iteration does not sound like a good idea.I do have all the C++ functionality available (the project is in C++, just using a C library), but using std::vector is no good because the collected data is later sent in to a function with a definition similar to:Any ideas? Only things I can think of are realloc or using a std::vector and copying the data into an array afterwards, and those don't sound too promising.
8778583	I think best solution would be to write your own 1D array class with some methods which you need.depending on how you write the class you'll get such result. (sorry bad grammar)..
8778623	Using realloc() in each iteration sounds like a very fine idea to me, for two reasons:"does not sound like a good idea" is what people usually say when they have not established a performance requirement for their software, and they have not tested their software against the performance requirement to see if there is any need to improve it.Instead of reallocating a new block each time, the realloc method will simply keep expanding your memory block which will presumably be at the top of the memory heap, so it won't be wasting any time either traversing memory block lists, or copying data around. This holds true provided that whatever memory allocated by myFunction() gets freed before it returns. You can verify it by looking at the pointer returned by realloc() and seeing that it always (or almost always(*1)) is the exact same pointer as the one you gave it to reallocate.EDIT (*1) some C++ runtimes implement two heaps, one for small allocations and one for large allocations, so if your block gets allocated in the heap for small blocks, and then it grows large, there is a possibility that it will be moved once to the heap for large blocks. So, don't expect the pointer to always be the same; just most of the time.

8813255	marker.getPosition() is not going to provide the street address. Given your current code, your best bet is to move:to your geocodePosition() function, and then to pass the infowindow object as a second argument to that function.So in your initialize() function you would modify calls to geocodePosition by including a second argument:Then in your geocodePosition() function, you would accept the second argument, and update it with the responses[0].formatted_address value. I added variables to make it easier to pass on the values for address and the message.
8815066	I have the following structure in my app:FragmentActivity with ViewPager holding multiple fragments managed by FragmentStatePagerAdapter using compativility pack with Android 2.1Each fragment contains ListView. Each element in the ListView has a LinearLayout with two TextViews and a Button. The LinearLayout and the button have onClickListeners (separate). Clicking on the LinearLayout starts another Activity. I noticed that the clicks behavior is very inconsistent: sometimes action is executed immediately but very often it is delayed and sometimes it's just ignored no matter how many times I tap. It gets even weirder because I can tap and the action will only be executed when I start scrolling the list. I tried various combinations of setFocusable(false) and setSelectable(true) but it seems to not make any difference. Any ideas? I'll be happy to provide more details.
8815154	It seems you are executing some blocking process(like invoking webservices or opening files) in event thread, so your Event thread is blocked. If this is the case, Please process your blocking code into another thread than Event THread.
8815473	WinEvents is the way to go here. The API you need is SetWinEventHook() - if you care about a specific window, use GetWindowThreadProcessId() to get the HWND's threadId and then listen to events only from that specific thread. For window title changes, you'll want the EVENT_OBJECT_NAMECHANGE event.You can hook either "in context" or "out of context" - the latter is the simplest, and means the event gets delivered back to your own process, so you don't need a separate DLL - which makes it possible to do it all in C#; but the thread that calls SetWinEventHook must have a message loop (GetMessage/TranslateMessage/DispatchMessage), since the events are delivered using a form of messages behind the scenes.In your WinEvent callback, you'll need to check that the HWND is the one you care about, since you'll get name changes for any UI on that target thread, possibly including child window name changes, or other things you don't care about.--By the way, you can check this answer for some sample C# code that uses WinEvents; it's using them to track foreground window changes across all windows on the desktop; but should just take a few simple modifications outlined above to track name changes on a specific window.

On my custom javascript object (I'll use PhoneNumber as an example for the sake of simplicity), I am setting a prototype function like this:Everything works fine except for the fact that for some reason it turns my Phone Number object into a generic Object instead of keeping its PhoneNumber constructor. If I actually place the write function inside the objects prototype like this, it works perfectly.But I'd really rather not have to do it this way because multiple objects use the write function and they all perform the exact same way. How can I avoid my objects converting themselves into generic constructors? Apparently I'm setting the Map object on the prototype the wrong way, but its quite important that I not have to copy the code directly from Map into the object prototype function. Any ideas?
8821356	It seems that the Object returned is PhoneNumber just without a toString method.Try this:
8821462	You forgot to set PhoneNumber.prototype.constructorWhen you do PhoneNumber.prototype = Map you destroy the constructor propertyOf course that won't work because your just doing Map.constructor = PhoneNumber which breaks if you use Map as multiple prototypes. So you should just have PhoneNumber inherit from map

That is why I assume there is some way to get this balance in web through some payment gateway.Thanks in advance for answers!
8834149	It seems that your confusion stems from the fact that you are thinking in an imperative context. The discussion of call-by-need vs. call-by-value mostly comes up about declarative and functional languages, and lambda calculus. You can see in this article about evaluation strategies that both call-by-name and call-by-need are considered lazy evaluation strategies. Lazy evaluation means that when an expression is passed as a parameter to a function, it is not evaluated before entering the function body, but only when it is accessed/read the first time inside the function. If the result of such expression is never used inside, then it will never be evaluated.For example the ? : operator is lazy in Java as the below code demonstrates:String test(Object obj){ return 1 == 2 ? obj.toString() : "Hello World";}test(null); // this won't throw a NullPointerExceptionCall-by-need is an essential feature of most functional languages which have a pure subset. In a purely functional language, every function has to be referentially transparent, i.e. they cannot have side-effects. Such pure functions have the property that for some given input they always return the same output, no matter how many times called, and that they never change anything in the "state of the world". They behave just like mathematical functions written on the paper.As you have already realized, call-by-need strategy is not feasible when calling non-pure functions, because you are most probably interested in the side-effects due to the consecutive calls. On the other hand it becomes an essential feature for performance when used in purely functional languages (see the second example below). Also, see these wiki pages about the concepts of Graph Reduction and Memoization.Real-world examplesFirst. One example of a commonly used system which uses graph reduction is Apache Ant. Ant does not evaluate a target twice. This design makes it convenient to sketch up a declarative build plan.Second. If you want to see a good demonstration of memoization, type this Haskell code to a GHC interpreter and see what happens:Prelude&gt; let fibs = 0:1:(zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs))-- This defines the Fibonacci sequence.Prelude&gt; fibs !! 200000-- Prints the 200,000th Fibonacci number,-- takes several seconds to calculate.Prelude&gt; fibs !! 200000-- Prints the same number as before,-- but this time it returns immediately.Note. You might also have heard about the call-by-value evaluation strategy. In contrast with call-by-name and call-by-need, call-by-value is a strict evaluation strategy. It is like call-by-name in the sense that calling multiple times result in multiple evaluation. This is the most common paradigm for programmers who are accustomed to imperative languages like C# or Java.
8836113	I've dealt with many credit card processing APIs and unless it is an API for a gateway solution, they generally do not have methods to do much in the way of querying for information. You might see some capability (again, in a gateway API but not in a lower-level processor's API) to load details of the original transaction, but not much else.This makes sense in terms of supporting high volume transactions. I visited FDMS once and talked to them a bit about their architecture. To maintain a > 1k TPS processing capability, they can't even wait for database writes when you're authorizing. That authorization code you get back is assigned from a pre-determined pool. The data about the transaction is pushed off to another process for persisting to a large back end system for later settlement. This is why many of the non-gateways have rules about waiting x minutes before trying to settle; the data isn't in the settlement system for a bit after authorization. This is also the reason why the authorization code expires after a while - they re-use it. (Someone got the bright idea that they'd charge you extra for letting the auth code expire.....probably due to the increased load of data they need to store in the settlement system waiting for these things to time out.)Checking a credit balance is also not part of a normal credit card processing workflow. Mostly you attempt to authorize and get one of 3 results: a hard decline, a soft decline, or an authorization. A balance check isn't really needed, and would probably open up some privacy or security issues if it were available.Cash cards (like pre-loaded Visas) use a different administrative activiation and management API. Gift cards work the same way, and you can use that administrative API to get balances. This is a special case because these technically aren't credit cards.I've not dealt much with the back end settlement networks that the issuing banks and the acquiring banks use to transfer data during settlement. To get this kind of info, you'd have to have access to this network. You might want to check the "any cash terminal will give you a balance" statement a bit. It would make sense that you could get your balance from an issuing bank's ATM, but try to do it on one of those third-party type machines you find in gas stations that is not from your issuing bank to see if it works. If you use a true credit card (not a debit card - that is a different network entirely), I don't know that it will show you your balance.
8852501	I have made this function, that seems to work fine, but it return "#" insted of wainting for the AJAX. I have tried to remove the return call, with out look. It need to wait until the AJAX is finish before return. The JSP is working fine.What is wrong?
8852570	If it is supposed to return something, put the return within the success callback. The async field doesn't do what you think it does in this situation.
8852654	Instead of adding your own validation method, you need to use the built-in remote validation method instead which is designed exactly for this purpose.You would use it in a manner likeCheck out the examples the docs link to.

8854873	ORDER is a reserved keyword in SQL Server (used in the ORDER BY operation).You need to delimit that name with brackets:"INSERT INTO [Order] (Status, CustomerID) VALUES "That will cause SQL Server to treat it as an object name instead of reading it as a keyword.

8863806	In VB.NET, can we pass an original object as an argument without instantiating it? For example, I have two forms in my project formA and formB. Now I have this code.Now I can use this in any event like:but ...Taking the same code in C#I cannot call it like:It gives the error  formB is type but is used like a variable.Instead, I have to call it like:Apart from this, in VB.NET in any class like formA, if I type formA, I can see all the objects and controls present there but not in C#. Again, I have to make a new instance to see all the controls. This becomes a problem if I want to manipulate two running and working instances with each other. So what basic thing am I missing here?(I am an amateur programmer migrating from VB.NET to C#. Things are going nice and clean expect for the ones I've recently figured out.)
8863858	I'm not certain, but I'm pretty sure VB does this kind of "pseudo-object-oriented programming" where formA and formB are objects, not classes. You do not create objects in VB in your situation, you are simply manipulating the objects formA and formB.When you migrate to C# you are dealing with objects and classes. Your class is "formA" but it is simply a framework for objects of the type "formA" that you will instantiate as objects.This article should explain this a little more.
8864943	FormA and FormB are classes in VB that can be instantiated just like they are in C#. However, Microsoft added support for automatic, default instances of forms to VB.Net in VS2005 in order to support developers migrating from VB classic that were getting confused by the need to create and manage instances of forms. However, this is NOT considered a best programming practice since it can lead to various issues, such as the inability to access the form from a background thread and the inability to create multiple instances of the form. Once you understand OOP and class instantiation, there is absolutely no reason to use the default instances. In fact, you can disable the use of default form instances by either creating a Sub New in the form that is declared Friend (so that it can be created elsewhere in the project):or by modifying the Public Sub New to include parameters:In either case, any references to the default instance of the form will result in the following two compile-time errors whereever the default instance is referenced: 'Form1' is a type in 'WindowsApplication1' and cannot be used as an expression.  Reference to a non-shared member requires an object reference.Having said all of that about how your current app works in VB.Net, the specific answer to your question about C# is that you always need to create new instances of the forms in C#.For example:
8866911	I used rel values in jQuery for the parametrized (#!hashbang) AJAX calls. and with jQuery:But, when I validated the page on validator.w3.org, it gave me error: Bad value #telephony for attribute rel on element a: Keyword #telephony is not registered.I searched around and according to the HTML5 specs here and here, the rel attribute should have the registered/pre-defined values. Is there a work around to use custom values for rel in HTML5, without failing the validation?Is it also invalid for HTML4 doctypes?
8866983	You can use custom attributes:It is HTML5 compliant, but not HTML4 or xHTML.You'll access the attribute just like you did with jQuery.You can find more informations on the HTML5 reference.
8867043	I'm doing some python benchmarking, and I've discovered that repeat(None) is much faster than while True or while 1:This sort of usage for a while loop was the last thing that I actually used while loops for. Is there any reason left to use whiles that I'm overlooking?
8867275	The while True is only slower because of the global lookup for True. If you use while 1 instead, the while-loop should handily beat the for-repeat (at least in terms of speed, beauty, and clarity): The main use case for repeat is to supply a stream of constant values to imap or izip. For example, the following computes the sum of powers-of-two: sum(imap(pow, repeat(2), xrange(10))). The repeat itertool can also be used to speed-up a for-loop that doesn't need a changing variable. For example, Guido used this technique to minimize looping overhead in the timeit module:  To answer your other question, "are there any reasons to use a while-loop". The answer is yes. Python's for-loop is really a foreach that consumes iterators to produce a stream of values. In contrast, a while-loop is either unbounded (as in the while-True example) or terminated when a specific condition is met (for example, looping over user inputs until the user types "quit" or somesuch). The contrasting capabilities of while-loops and for-loops can be seen in the example of the Collatz conjecture where the while-loop cannot be easily replaced with a for-loop:Many more examples and use cases for while-loops can be seen by grepping over Python's standard library.In summary, the while-statement is an essential part of your toolkit :-)
8867708	You can use any other attribute of 'a' tag for eg. 'title'
8868765	repeat(None) is faster than while True but not while 1 because while True triggers lookup for GLOBAL variable True.while 1 is about 14% faster than repeat(None).
8872070	I have a mail server running on a linux server.Internally, I can access it via https://192.168.0.253/webaccess and externally I can access it via https://webmail.mydomain.com/webaccessI'd like to be able to access webmail.mydomain.com internally, the problem is that a DNS lookup to this address goes to the public IP of our network and from within, that won't work.I have bind9 installed on our linux server (internal) and can use that for DNS lookups - that server is my primary DNS address. Could anyone please describe how I can configure bind to resolve webmail.mydomain.com to 192.168.0.253?
8872074	I have the following class:And a very simple test that is able to produce the issue:Valgrind warns about an invalid write, and debugging has shown why. FixedByteStream received; calls the constructor with no arguments (which is kind of stupid because it can't do anything). received = FixedByteStream(12); calls the constructor with the integer argument... and then immediately calls the destructor on itself, invalidating the object. It still works for some reason, but I'd rather it not be placed in such an odd predicament that throws warnings.So, why is it being called there? I could somewhat understand if the destructor were called first, to get rid of the useless temporary object (not that it needs to), but I have used that kind of declare-now-assign-later pattern practically everywhere and never had such an issue before.
8872123	It seems you don't understand object lifecycle and mistakenly interpret this code as a Java code.When you write FixedByteStream received; an object of type FixedByteStream is created using the no-argument constructor. And when you write received = FixedByteStream(12); another object is created, = operator is called and the newly created object is desctructed.Also you didn't override operator= so the object is copied by bytes, which is not correct.
8872191	You are missing an assignment operator. Remember the rule of three (or five).The problem is roughly like this:You provide no assignment operator so the pointer value in the temporary is simply copied into t and then the memory pointed to is deleted in the destructor of the temporary.Also: Don't have a default constructor, if the object constructed is invalid.

8875687	Link to the source directly:Or via Google API:Read the manual, Search online before asking
8876439	The addJs, addCSS, etc. action methods are specifically designed for local files. You can't use them to add files at external URLs to the page. Instead, you'll need to add the URLs directly to Magento's head template.You can do this by copying the base head template at To your theme's template folderapp/design/frontend/default/your-theme/template/page/html/head.phtmlIf you look at that template, you'll see the HTML and PHP template code used to render the head element of all Magento HTML pages. You can simply add HTML tags to this file to add any additional script tags you need. Don't forget to use the removeItem method to ensure the local prototype.js is NOT rendered. If you wanted to get really fancy, rather than edit the template you could use Layout XML to add new scripts with something like this(advice here is 1.6.1 specific, but should apply to most, if not all, versions of Magento)
8884782	EDIT: Thanks everyone. I didn't even notice it was private lol, so I changed them from private to public, now it should be accessible... question now is how can I access the value of say 'backpackPosition'? thanks again!
8884847	Private members are just that - private. Only the class they belong to can access them. If you want to be able to retrieve their values, you need to either make them protected (and thus available to parent and children classes) or public (available to all classes). Another option is to write some getters, functions that look likeor use the __get() magic function to make a general getter that looks likeMore info can be found in the documentation at

8886796	I have the following LINQ query:How can I check if the query did return 1 recordas I cannot do .Count to get the count.
8886885	You are using an ID for the where condition, I think you should've already guaranteed that this query returns only one result.If your problem is having no result please check the usage of FirstOrDefault() from MSDN title.
8886971	First of all, that is not a valid query. When you use the query syntax (from blah in blah ...), you must have a select clause. It should be more like:To answer your question, calling FirstOrDefault() on your query will return the first result of the query or the default value for the type (most likely null in this case). For what you're going for, this won't be an adequate use since the query may contain more than one result.If you wish to verify that the query only returns a single result, you should use the SingleOrDefault() method instead. It will return either the one item produced by the query, the default value null if it was empty or throw an exception if there was more than one item.If you don't want to throw an exception, it may be easier to just throw the results into a list and verify that the count of items is one.
8888214	What is the running time of this algorithm:I want to say O(n^4) but I can't be certain. How do you figure this out?
8888258	n^4 is correct. The inner loop takes an average of (n^2)/2 time to run, because i goes up to n^2 linearly, and it is run (n^2) times.
8888351

8910202	Keep it simple. You could probably do it in seemingly 'smarter' way, but in fact it would probably only make code less readable.

8911737	When you instantiate and configure an alertview, you may assign it's delegate to your presenting view controller. In the delegate method:Your presenting class must conform to the UIAlertViewDelegate protocol (do this in your header). Then, in your implementation, implement the delegate method:Within this delegate method, you determine which button was pushed (by index). If the button at the index you wish to "link" was pressed, you can then link through to a web page (in Safari) or present your own web view.
8911959	The only way I see to implement what you are trying to is through a custom alert view.There are several approaches that you can take. One is subclassing UIAlertView and here you can find a short tutorial: Subclass UIAlertView. In your subclass you could then build the alert any way you like to implement the touch-enabled text. Have a look at this tutorial for a way to do it.You can find other approaches to custom UIAlertView in this S.O. article.

8930317	When we use SSL(Secured Socket Level) Server has private key whereas client has public key. In such cases client encrypt data and server decrypt it to get actual details, but how it will work if server is sending some critical financial details to client. In this situation as client has only public key so whether it is possible for key to decrypt details.In short how secure communication from server-->Client works.
8930394	Well, in reverse? The server logs in to the client with ssl in the same way as the client would log into the server? That is, if you require a separate connection. If the server sends back the sensitive information within the same secure session, there is no security problem.But maybe I don't understand your question correctly :)
8930442	Public key cryptography is only used during the SSL/TLS handshake to agree on shared keys. The encryption/decryption of the data on top of SSL/TLS is then done using these shared keys.You should read about Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and RSA Key Exchange.Here is a document describing the principles of the key exchange: There is also a description of how this applies to SSL/TLS here:
8935962	Hi all,I have about 10 jars and when I run my program I invoke the following:I want to make this as an executable jar. I thought that when I unjar (that sounds weird, but I'm using java command - not using general zip program) the jar containing [package][class], update manifest.mf and rejar it. Unfortunately, this did not work.Is it possible for me to make it as an executable jar or I should unjar it and sum it all?
8936009	You just need this line in your manifest fileThen run the jar command with the m flag, and give it the name of your manifest file:Unfortunately, jars can't contain other jars. Give the jar containing your entry point a Main-Class, and then set the classpath so that the other 9 jars are accessible.
8936015	Jar is a collection of files. To make a jar an executable the most important thing is that it should contain a class that has the main() method. So, you can make a jar executable only if contains a .class file that has a main method. That class will look like this.Then and only then can you make a jar executable.If the main() method class is present. Then to make the jar executable do this.Extract the jarIn the manifest file add this line Main-Class:AClass and don't forget to press enter after this line. follow this link Rejar the class files. You got the executable jar nowTo execute the jar, (suppose you made a.jar executable), then run java -jar a.jar to run the jar file.Second thing is that the command that you have posted in the question does not require those jars to be executable. When you use -cp, then the parameters (i.e. a.jar etc..)are basically libraries or in other words, when java will look for a class file to find definition of a class or a function or whatever for that matter, it will look inside these jars if what it is looking for is not part of the java standard library.
8936363	I'm trying to run the sample unit tests for the sample code that ships with the android SDK. Some of the tests run as standard unit tests, no problem. Other tests, such as com.example.android.apis.view.Focus2AndroidTest, use android classes, and therefore need to run in the emulator, that is a problem.I can run applications just fine in my emulator. When I run tests, though, my emulator starts up, and then just sits there. The test never runs. All I see in the output window in IntelliJ is What am I doing wrong?EDIT:After @CrazyCoder's advice, I switched to android 4.0.3 (API 15).

8936620	I need to keep track of users who are online on my site so I can show a "online" icon next to the avatars of users who are online.The first step of detecting this is to keep track of when the user was last seen so I am doing an UPDATE query each time the user requests a page:Now right after this, I execute another query, this one gets all the users of my site under certain criterion so I can display them on the homepage:Never mind the craziness of this query, basically the point is I am selecting from the same users table that I was previously updating.When I execute these 2 queries one after another these are the times I get:This causes a noticeable delay in page load time.Now when I created a separate table for online users and change the first query to this:The times changed to this:and the page loads much faster!Why is this? My guess is that it has something to do with table locking but I don't know enough to be sure or know more details.
8936773	Because SELECT * includes last_seen MySQL cannot cache the query or subqueries. You might try an explicit enumeration of all fields but last_seen.(But a separate table online_users makes much sense.)
8936777	query on innoDB table is slower than on MyISAM.more rows in table make query more slow.wrong indexing on table make query more slow, check with EXPLAIN command.
8937762	Can you run normal apps in the emulator or USB device? Try to create the new emulator device and see if helps.I've tried it with IDEA 11.0.1, 4.0.3 Android platform on Windows and it works fine:You can also try to restart adb with adb kill-server and start the emulator manually from AVD manager.Verify that there is no pre-installed ApiDemos application in the emulator, or the signatures will not match. Uninstall existing ApiDemos, then try to deploy and run ApiDemos from IntelliJ IDEA, then try to run the test configuration again.UPDATE: We did some research and found the source of the problem. By default IntelliJ IDEA sets the dependency scope for the application module inside test module to Compile, so that all the production and test classes get compiled into the single Test.apk.Instead, the scope must be set to Provided and we'll fix it in the next update. Right now you need to correct it manually as shown on the screenshot:Rebuild the project and run the tests, again, this time 2 separate apk files will be deployed, one for the main app and the second one for the tests, then tests will run:
8937895	Running unit tests in emulator is not practical (basically takes too long). And since android jars are usefull only to compiling, it seems impossiblble to run them with unit tests. Good alternative is use of advanced mocking framework ( I personally prefer jMockit, but there are other ) See example:https://github.com/ko5tik/andject/blob/master/src/test/java/de/pribluda/android/andject/ViewInjectionTest.javaHere I test my class against derived android activity, and it has to call superclass methods(this runs in maven, eclipse or IDEA on the spot )
8938318	I wrote a PHP file which should insert values in a MySQL database.I explain my problem with an example.In the database, there is 'kn';I cut the string from the umlaut.
8938497	Yikes! Your code has a very, very serious security flaw: it is vulnerable to a SQL injection. Imagine, for example, that $title is "foo'); drop table recipes; --". No more recipes! (See .)You should never, ever insert raw user input into a SQL statement, in PHP or in any other language.The best way to prevent the attack is if the database driver allows placeholder values, which work something like this: "INSERT INTO RECIPES (title) VALUES (?)", $title. Unfortunately, the standard PHP MySQL driver does not support this. It is a major shortcoming of the platform.The best approach I could find in PHP is:sprintf("INSERT INTO RECIPES (title) VALUES ('%s')", mysql_real_escape_string($title))Note the all-important call to mysql_real_escape_string. That will close the security hole — and very likely will also fix the umlaut issue you're having!More info:
8938940	If your database collation is Unicode or UTF-8, just do:The only difference is the N character which makes it possible to insert Unicode data into the database.And you have to take the security risks seriously. Use mysql_real_escape_string together with other required actions to protect against sql injections. (If you don't do it now, you'll forget it when writing a big real-world application.)

8939579	The simplest fixComma separated To:Whilst mail will allow you to send using a comma separated list of recipients this will not preserve their privacy. This is why I have used two calls to mail() so that they cannot see others email addresses.Using BCC:Using a BCC: with mail() requires passing in the headers parameter. This is not recommended - see below.SuggestionsI would not recommend using the mail() function directly. Use SwiftMailer or PHPMailer as they provide more flexibility, safety and a better programming API.

8946558	I am trying to learn Javascript.There are some excellent books and great authors that became standard in JS world - As I can see, they all have their own way of interpretation of language. It can be sometimes confusing for the novice in Javascript.I wonder, how usefull can be to learn directly from ECMAScript language specification as it was published by the authors of the language ?
8946589	It's probably much better to learn from the tutorials, as the specification is designed for people implementing JavaScript parsers/interpreters, not for people learning JavaScript itself. If you want to learn from a reference, the MDN is a fantastic resource. There are also plenty of tutorials out there.
8946598	JavaScript is one of the most controversial languages in existence, there is no clear author and no clear documentation.The best project I know of is Mozilla Developer Network (or MDN), it's pretty extensive and comprehensive.
8947272	I have a Glassfish 3.1.1 web application for Java EE 6 running. one of my classes has a native library dependency. I'm using JNI to use this native method. Part of that process involves creating a shared library .so file. In one of my Java classes there will be a System.Loadlibrary("library"); call that references that library.so file. My questions is, where should I place this shared library as well as the native code that it references in order to access and use this JNI functionality on Glassfish. I'll need to make calls to several C++ programs that can be moved anywhere on the machine that that Glassfish is hosted on. Should I put them in the domain1/ext folder? add them as a native library to a jar in the build path. How is this done?
8947405	When I Use a JNI Wrapped DLL in Windows Based server, Have Place the DLL in You can try placing .so on linux machine at just a try.
8947485	Use the following Glassfish command to set the path where your native libraries are located:It is also possible to set the native library location via the Admin Console. If you want flexibility in moving/renaming the libraries, you can use symbolic links. What is the advantage of this to adding a native library through Eclipse build path?The JVM needs to know the native library path. If you launch the JVM from Eclipse (e.g. unit testing with the native library), then you will need to configure the path in Eclipse. However, if you launch the JVM from Glassfish (by using the Eclipse Glassfish Adapter) then Glassfish itself needs to be configured.
8949672	I need to employ some sort of licensing on some Linux applications that I don't have access to their code base.What I'm thinking is having a separate process read the license key and check for the availability of that application. I would then need to ensure that process is run during every invocation of the respected application. Is there some feature of Linux that can assist in this? For example something like the sudoers file in which I detect what user and what application is trying to be launched, and if a combination is met, run the license process check first.Or can I do something like not allow the user to launch the (command-line) application by itself, and force them to pipe it to my license process as so:/usr/bin/tm | license_process // whereas '/usr/bin/tm' would fail on its own
8949796	You could write a wrapper binary that does the checks, and then link in the real application as part of that binary, using some dlsym tricks you may be able to call the real main function from the wrapper main function.IDEAread up on ELF-hacking: use ld to rename the main function of the program you want to protect access to. write a wrapper that does the checks and uses dlopen and dlsym to call the real main.link together real application with your wrapper, as one binary.Now you have an application that has your custom checks that are somewhat hard to break, but not impossible.I have not tested this, don't have the time, but sort of fun experiment.
8950818	I need to employ some sort of licensing on some Linux applicationsPlease note that license checks will generally cost you way more (in support and administration) than they are worth: anybody who wants to bypass the check and has a modicum of skill will do so, and will not pay for the license if he can't anyway (that is, by not implementing a licensing scheme you are generally not leaving any money on the table). that I don't have access to their code base.That makes your task pretty much impossible: the only effective copy-protection schemes require that you rebuild your entire application, and make it check the license in so many distinct places that the would be attacker gets bored and goes away. You can read about such schemes here. I'm thinking is having a separate process read the license key and check for the availability of that application.Any such scheme will be bypassed in under 5 minutes by someone skilled with strace and gdb. Don't waste your time.
8957341	Hello I want to remove a complete li with input only if you clicked on the [x] how i can do this ?UPDATEHere is a demo for my problem..
8957356	Remove that jQuery rubbish, and just use this:

8957762	As I've always understood it, the main cases where an instanceof is appropriate are:Implementing Object.equals(Object). So if I were writing a List class, and not extending AbstractList for whatever reason, I would implement equals(o) by first testing o instanceof List, and then comparing elements.A significant (algorithmic?) optimization for a special case that does not change semantics, but only performance. For example, Collections.binarySearch does an instanceof RandomAccess test, and uses a slightly different binary search for RandomAccess and non-RandomAccess lists.I don't think instanceof represents a code smell in these two cases. But are there any other cases where it is sensible to use instanceof?
8957816	As you have mentioned, the "correct" uses of instanceof are rather limited. As far as I know, you have basically summed up the two main uses.However you can generalize your statements a bit though as follows:Type-checking before necessary casts.Implementing special case scenarios that depend on very particular class instances
8957832	Legacy code or APIs outside of your control are a legitimate use-case for instanceof. (Even then I'd rather write an OO layer over it, but timing sometimes precludes a redesign like that.)In particular, factories based on external class hierarchies seem a common usage.
8959582	I am trying to build an array of custom object references. Here is some simplified code.Result:Can anyone unbang my head from the wall? I am storing the same reference 5 times over, correct? How do I not do that? I would like to store a reference to each unique City object.
8959597	You're storing the same location array in each city. Make a new array for each one and you should be good to go.
8959607	You are passing same diameter and location to the City constructor while creating City object, you need to find a way to pass different diameter and location each time you create a City object.store the different diameter and location in an array and pass proper values while creating City Object.
8972643	I've read numerous articles on this topic and tried implementing a few, but I just can't seem to get it right. I have a simple HTML table, which compares products:What I want is for the header row to always be on top of the active window, that is the top row when I scroll down, since my rows go down quite far. I want to keep the product names in the tags always visible so that a user can relate the content to the different products in the very top row all the time.Thank you in advance!
8972745	I simple technique is to have the header row in a separate table from the actual data.This header table is set to have it's position as fixed, and then the table below, which holds the results, has it's margin-top set the height of the header table.This creates the effect of the header staying where it is and the table scrolling.A basic example here: You can also create a fixed header with jQuery plugins. Take a look at this one  really simple to implement.EditAs Anders has mentioned, if you go down my suggested route, you will need to set the widths of the th and td elements. Otherwise they would not match up since they are separate tables.
8974331	I am generating some data of latitude and longitude with rand(10000000, 3000000); for example. But I need to calculate distance between two locations, so basically I need to convert my result, for example 22049256 to 22.049256 in order to pass to my function.How can I achieve this most effectively with using least amount of resources?TL;DRI have integer 22049256, needs to be converted to float 22.049256.
8974417	Divide by 1M?22049256 / 1000000 = 22.049256
8974438	Simplest way would be to treat the number as a string and iterate through it, adding the decimal point at the appropriate position.Edit:Another possibility is to divide by 1000000 and run number_format to ensure proper decimal places:
8976150	Given the following code snippet:Why does the compiler think this is not a constant expression ?But given that I use InvisiblePropInterfaces like this, the compiler is just happy?
8976297	Erm because you told it to expect oneTInvisiblePropInterfaces.Create(const GUIDS: array of TGUID); Your attribute knows absolutely nothing about MyIntf
8976805	The pertinent section of the attributes documentation is this: It is important to understand that the values passed to the attribute's constructor must be constant expressions. Because those values must be embedded directly into the resulting binary, it is impossible to pass an expression that requires run-time evaluation. This raises a few limitations to the information that can be passed to the attribute at compile time:   Only constant expressions are allowed, including sets, strings, and ordinal expressions. out and var parameters cannot be used, because they require run-time evaluation of addresses of passed parameters. Addr() intrinsic and @ operator cannot be used. The TypeInfo() operator can be used to pass type information, because the RTTI block addresses are known at compile time. Class references are allowed, because the metaclass addresses (as the case of TypeInfo()) are known at compile time. The key point is that a constant expression is a technical Pascal term that is not the same thing as a constant. I suspect that this is the root of the confusion.Since it is not possible to have a constant expression that can be passed to a TGUID, you are out of luck with your attribute. Indeed it is just as impossible to have a constant expression that can be passed to an open array parameter.I suppose that you could use the string representation of the GUID to solve the conundrum but that will leave you with messy duplication and an inability to pass arrays of GUIDs.
8978248	Is there a way to call IE conditionals from within CSS? I want to avoid calling a long string of IE css files from my code.and would like to have one calland have the conditionals within the css file. Is that possible or is Paul Irish the way to go?I tried applying the "advanced rules" suggested in this articlebut this doesn't work for me. I tried something basic, like
8978375	You could also try loading the CSS dynamically on the server side. Get the user agent from the request object, if they are using IE version x, append CSS files 1, 2, 3 concatenated together. Just make sure that mime type of the response is CSS or plain text...
8978478	Use the conditional code to add a class to the HTML element. Then use that class to select elements only for the version of ie.In ie8, the body element will have 98% width, in ie7, 100% width, and in IE6 and lower, 50%.
8978774	I've looked around and cannot figure this one out: I have a object that implemens an observer pattern and a List implementation that allows listeners to be added on the list whenever a change event is triggered on any object in the list to avoid manual add/remove listeners to each object int the list. The problem I have is when creating a new instance of the same List implementation and adding objects from existing lists the object changes are not getting triggered from beans added to the new list. My thought was that when adding an object to a Collection it just adds a pointer to the existing object which given this case the change notifications would be getting triggered on objects in the new list but this is not happening. Can anyone help me figure out what the problem might be? I have seen similar questions but none that can help me solve this problem. The use case, is a stock scanner where one list has all the stocks in the market I'm watching and the scanner list only has the stocks that pass the criteria but the scanner is not getting updates like price, volume etc that get triggered using the observation pattern. - Duncan
8978815	Yes, in Java every class (but not simple types) is been passed by reference.To solve your problem, you can use clone, if your objects support it.
8978818	Your understanding was correct; collections hold references to objects. For example, this:will print this:because there was only a single StringBuilder instance, so the appended "yes" is in every element of the list.But note that the collections hold those references by value, not by reference. For example, this:will print this:because the two elements of the list refer to different objects, even though both objects were identified by the same variable.For more help in figuring out what's going wrong with your code, I think you'll have to post a minimal program that demonstrates the issue.
8978820	I tried the ClearSelection method, it is deselecting the row but the selected cell is still highlighted
8979013	I've done this, but I used a much different approach. I wrote plain POJOs and Plain Java Interfaces without messing around with the strange abstract classes, remote stub compilers, or a plethora of checked exceptions associated with the Java RMI API. Then I used Spring Remoting to connect everything and Spring took care of the RMI transport:Take a look at the manual here:Here's an example of a bean that will proxy out to a remote registry:This solves your problem, but probably doesn't answer your question exactly... the old RMI API from Java is quite antiquated though, Spring lets you work with "just plain java".

8983891	What happens if you try to add an item to a Collection that already exists in the Collection? Let's say you have a Collection full of integers and you try to add an integer that is already in the Collection.
8983907	If you try to add something with the same key as a key already in the collection, it throws an error (docs). You can add the same object to a collection twice as long as you use different keys for it.Side note: Microsoft ended all official support for the VB6 development environment nearly four years ago. The runtime remains supported at least through Windows&nbsp;7 (e.g., so existing apps continue to run). See this other question and its answers for more details.
8985181	If your problem lays with the delay that UIWebView introduces when rendering the HTML, so that you do not want to show the user a blank page and only after a second or so the rendered page, the only way I have come up to deal with this is:having initially the UIWebView hidden;defining webViewDidFinishLoad so that when it fires the web view is made visible.If you put your UIWebView into a contaning view and define its alpha properly, you can get nice transitions with this approach.
8985779	Simply put if you add an item to a collection twice, it will be in the collection twice.If you add it with a key then that needs to be unique.

If you do not want the text to sit on the lines but instead want it to be between them, you can omit the background-position property. Example:

9001666	I am using jQuery.post() to send data to the server, when the server sends data back to the client, the post() callback is invoked. I know that the server might response with the redirect header field ("Location").currently, the redirect does not occur. what can be the reason?is there any possibility to run a script before the redirect occur?UPDATE:enclosed a snipped code. i know that the POST method is accepted by the server, and that the server responds to the POST. somehow, always the error() is being invoked (it seems like it happends even before the response is accepted by the client\browswer).what is wrong?
9001696	If you perform an operation that results in a redirect, JQuery does not detect it. The browser handles it automatically behind the scenes, to create a seamless experience.
9002071	jquery.post() works by issuing an Ajax request. In an Ajax call, the PHP script works asynchronously (think of it as a background thread). Thus, the PHP script cannot redirect the client's browser. The way to go would be to have the PHP script responsd with the URL to redirect to, and redirect using javascript.In your POST callback:EDITFrom Jquery documentation on jquery.ajax() statusCode(added 1.5)MapA map of numeric HTTP codes and functions to be called when the response has the corresponding code. For example, the following will alert when the response status is a 404:If the request is successful, the status code functions take the same parameters as the success callback; if it results in an error, they take the same parameters as the error callback.
9003380	I thought I understood how left outer joins work, but I have a situation that is not working, and I'm not 100% sure if the way I have my query structured is incorrect, or if it's a data issue.For background, I have the following MySQL table structures:andAs for the data, this is what I have populated here (only pertinent columns included for brevity):andIn this particular case, the achievement table is the "master" table and will contain the information that I always want to see. The gamer_achievement table only contains information for achievements that are actually earned. For any particular game for any particular gamer, there can be any number of rows in the gamer_achievement table - including none if no achievements have been earned for that game. For example, in the sample data above, achievements with ids 5, 6, 11, and 12 have not been earned.What I currently have written isbut this is only returning the full information for those achievements that have actually been earned - the unearned achievement information from the right side table (gamer_achievement) is not being show with the NULL values as I would expect from this type of query. This is what I am expecting to see:What am I missing here? From what I understand, the basic query LOOKS right to me, but I'm obviously missing some piece of critical information.
9003447	My guess is that the where clause is filtering out your desired results, moving it to the left join may work.
9003894	Many have answered, but I'll try too and hopefully lend in some more clarification. How I have always interpreted it (and you can check so many other posts I've responded to with LEFT joins), I try to list the table I want everything from first (left side... hence read from left to right). Then left join to the "Other" table (right side) on whatever the criteria is between them... Then, when doing a left join, and there are additional criteria against the right side table, those conditions would stay with that join condition. By bringing them into the "WHERE" clause would imply an INNER JOIN (must always match) which is not what you want... I also try to always show the left table alias.field = right table alias.field to keep the correlation clear... Then, apply the where clause to the basis criteria you want from the first table.. something likeNotice the direct relation between "a" and "ga" by the common ID and game ID values, but then tacked on the specific gamer. The where clause only cares at the outer level of achievement based on the specific game.

9007010	Is there any way to reorder elements in a Node objects such that they match an xsd:sequence order? I've read through the docs for Node.normalize, but it doesn't seem to perform that function. Is there something else that can be done?I believe that it can be done with XSLT, but it would sound like an overly convoluted solution to use XSLT, and a special java-xlst parser to perform the manipulation as opposed to having something native in java.Or would I actually need to code a complex function to do the processing for me?
9007902	You can manipulate XML directly in Java using the following packages:You'll need to put an XML parser such as saxon ( see  ) on your classpathYou can manipulate the XML 'by hand', reading bits of the input document and creating the required output document or you can write an xslt style sheet and use it to transform the document straight from your Java code.Try here for a starting point:
9008973	I have a database script in a .sql file for sql server 2008 that I want to execute against my database. Rather this being a manual exercise, I would like to automate it. I have 3 options available to me, a batch file, powershell or c#. The way I execute this will be influenced by my next question - I want to execute the script but also be aware in code if the script fails to execute for any reason? This will be part of a general set of install steps so want the install to halt if the script does not execute correctly.
9009052	Run it as a SQL agent job, you can set SQL agent to send you alerts if the script fails.
9009065	You can also pack this in stored procedure and there use some error handling.
9010828	I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here but I'm trying to set two conditions through using "where" and they each work alone, but when I combine them I get a dump of every file.If I simply have:I get two listings because there are two types (a &amp; b). If I have I get 538 listings which is everything of type "a".However, if I have:I get all of the files. Why isn't it just giving me the single file with the name and type I've specified? It seems like I'm missing something obvious!
9010981	If you only have xs:sequence to worry about, and not choice/repetition, and so long as the schema isn't written to use lots of complex features like named model groups and substitution groups and wildcards, then it shouldn't be too difficult, at any rate if you use XSLT 2.0 or XQuery and forget about trying to code it in Java. If the variable $seq is an xs:sequence element, then the sort key for an element named $E is "count($x/xs:element[(@name|@ref)=$E]/preceding-sibling::*", so you can just plug this expression into an xsl:sort asProbably needs a bit of finessing for namespaces or other things you might encounter, but you get the idea.

9013743	I acknowledged error in my response by adding a comment to original question a long time ago. Now, I am updating this post in interest of keeping future readers from being misguided as I was. Please see notes from other users below - they are correct. Google does not make use of the revisit-after meta tag. I am still keeping the original response text here to make sure that anyone else looking for similar answer will find it here along with this note confirming that this meta tag IS NOT VALID! Hope this helps someone.You may use HTML meta tag as follows: Adjust time period as necessary. There is no guarantee that robots will return in given time frame but this is how you are telling robots about how often a given page is likely to change.The Revisit Meta Tag is used to tell search engines when to come back next.
9025478	I am trying to concat a string inside the attribute. I get an error. I think that it is related to my Eval. Is there a proper way to concat strings, or is this just not possible. The problem I believe is where I set the NavigateUrl.
9025928	Try this instead:You don't need to concatenate
9026445	Google has three modes of entering a website into its results - discover, crawl, index.In order to 'discover' your site, it must be made aware of it's existence - normally through back-links. If you're site is brand new you can use the submit URL form - but this isn't really a trusted method. You're better off signing up for a Google Webmaster Tools account and submitting your site. An additional step is to submit an XML sitemap of your site. If you are publishing to your site in a blogging/posting way - you can always consider PubSubHubbub.From there on, crawl frequency is normally based on site popularity (as measured by ye olde PageRank). Depth of crawl (crawl-budget) is also determined by PR.
9027318	Short answer: NavigateUrl='&lt;%# Eval("Key.Id", "ViewItem.aspx?id={0}") %&gt;'Longer explanation:The problem in your code is that you are use data binding expression only for part of your web control attribute. You need to move everything inside the data binding expression.First of all, a data binding expression is this:Basically the rule for using a data binding expression for a web control attribute is that the expression must be the only thing in the attribute:So your first attribute, Text, is correct. But your second attribute, NavigateUrl is not correct. Because you put ViewItem.aspx?id= as the value for the attribute, leaving + '&lt;%# Eval("Key.Id") %&gt;' outside any attribute but inside the control tag.Here is the correct syntax:Notice that we are using a format string as the second parameter for Eval(). This is equivalent to the following, more explicit, syntax:

Example: static belongsTo = PostA user can have multiple postA Post belongs to a UserA Post can have multiple subscribers Version Grails 1.3.7
9046931	In this case, your belongsTo shouldn't reference the instance of user, it just needs to be generic.I believe this is because GORM gets confused by your declaration of a back reference in the belongsTo because the hasMany takes care of the back reference.

(I had a look at CodeProject but couldn't find much).Thank you.
9049605	The quick-and-dirty usercontrol with an image and a separate label is your best option. Just add a public string property to set the label's text and you're pretty much done.

9051966	For a sample rate of Fs = 8 khz the FFT will give meaningful results from DC to Nyquist (= Fs / 2), i.e. 0 to 4 kHz. The width of each FFT bin will be 1 / 20 ms = 50 Hz.

9080470	I made an on-line survey in asp.net using c#. My survey contains 30 questions each question on a different page.I want to display a progress bar that will show the user how much he completed. How can I do that?
9080570	There is most easy way for this is to have 30 Images with representing progress over there and then use each one on the top or bottom of the page to show the progress.
9080626	You could use individual images or you could use a small bit of CSS to calculate this:We'll suppose we know what page we're on and it's stored in a variable somewhere in our code.Given that, we can do a quick percentage calculation of the current progress:If we're on page 3:With this stored in a variable we can use it to set the width of our progres bar, relative to its parent:(You'd be writing the value to the CSS statement using your language of choice, C# in this case).Here's a quick sample of how it might look:
9083580	Apparently when you try to open "file.txt" with fopen, the file must be actually just named "file". If you add an extention, fopen won't recognize it.
9084434	I bet you have the Windows "hide extensions" bugfeature turned on. So the file which is really called "file.txt" appears in your Explorer as "file". And if it appeared to be "file.txt" in the Explorer, it would have to be named "file.txt.txt" on the hard drive.

9106706	Can anyone help me to create a simple viewing of cam using just a simple TVideo component in delphi having a vid size of 160x120 only as default (no resize). Just a simple one. Please. Badly needed for my new project. thanks.
9107243	There are many ways to do it , I couldn't understand what do you mean by TVideo component but my solution can show image on a paintbox(any TCanvas) use this is a directX conversion to pascal made by michael@grizzlymotion.comadd VSample.pas and VFrames.pas to your project
9108328	I don't know what TVideo is, but if you can use another component, for non-commercial projects, the Mitov Video library is free. It works with DirectX video, which is what most (all?) webcams use. It comes with excellent example programs, including one that plays back videos.You can accomplish your goal with almost no programming. You simply drag and drop his components and connect them in his GUI component editor (named OpenWire)in the IDE. We have used their components for years and are very happy with them. Highly recommended.They also have great real-time plotting and audio processing tools that all work together with threading built-in to make it fast, fast, fast..

9130110	I am extracting duplicated values from nested arrays. I would like to delete these extraceted items from the $bigarray. would you give me some ideas...?
9130295	You should look at array_merge as it will merge 2 arrays together and only keep one duplicate. From the manual: If the input arrays have the same string keys, then the later value for that key will overwrite the previous one. If, however, the arrays contain numeric keys, the later value will not overwrite the original value, but will be appended.Sounds like homework and the question isn't very clear so that is all I can provide for now.

9137968	Some Perl modules, such as DBI, need to be downloaded, compiled and installed.I'm connecting to a remote production testing computer, for which I have only my local user password (no root, for obvious reasons). I've used wget to download some external modules that I need, such as DBI, and unpacked these resulting in directories like ~/modules/DBI-&lt;version&gt;.Normally, when compiling something for Linux, you run configure to pre-configure everything before installation; and one of its switches is --prefix=&lt;some_dir&gt;, which controls where the compiled executable and all compiled dependencies will ultimately end up.But for Perl modules, you don't run configure, so my first question is:Can I control where the compiled modules (e.g. DBI.pm) go when I run make? If so, how?Failing that, I at least need to update @INC, so I can refer to the module; so my second question is:How can I find out where the compiled modules went when I ran make?I can't issue make install after compiling, and moreover, I've been asked not to. (I've been asked to design the script so that it doesn't rely on external modules being in the standard system path.)
9138332	You can use local::lib to install Perl modules in a custom directory. Modules so installed can be used from Perl scripts:cpanm uses local::lib internally when you use the -l or -L flag. To install a module in the current directory:

9140626	In database terminology:What is the difference between a row and a record?Likewise, aren't columns and fields the same thing?On the blog Joe Celko The SQL Apprentice , I noticed that the banner mentions that they are different things.
9140654	Row and record can arguably be considered as the same thing.Fields and columns are different, a field is the intersection of a row and a column.i.e. if your table has 10 rows and 10 columns, it has 100 fields.When you create a table using DDL statements, you define columns (metadata).When you add rows using DML statements, you define rows and their fields.
9140935	The installation directory is set when the makefile for the module is built. Each module comes with a Makefile.PL which must be run to build the makefile, taking into account the current Perl configuration. Makefile.PL has the option PREFIX that says where the build is going to be installed, so after unpacking the module's distribution and cding to the unpacked directory you can sayThis process is described in the Perl documentation - read perldoc perlmodinstall. You could go into the CPAN shell and use the 'o' (lower-case) oprion that allows you to change the options passed to makefile.PL, but I think the manual build/test/install is more straightforward and gives you more control over the process.Remember to addto the start of your program to make sure Perl searches the new directory for modules.
9151402	I'm a c++ newbie, my code currently new's up on the heap in several places without calling delete. I know I need to do something about this.My typical usage is where I new up a class instance in another classes member method then the method returns the pointer to the object.If i change the return types from MyType* to std::tr1::shared_ptr will this fix my code to not leak memory?Thanks a lot.Edit:Also likewise, I currently store new'ed up objects as MyType* as a value in a std:map. This map is a private member to a class instance. If I simply change this to std::tr1::shared_ptr will this clear up these when it's owner (class) falls out of scope?Thanks again
9151416	As long as you understand how tr1 shared pointers work, yes.Look at Boost C++ shared_ptr&lt;> also - it might be more what you want.
9151497	It's a reasonable band-aid, sure.A shared pointer is a reference-counted pointer. So as long as one or more shared_ptrs exist pointing to an object, that object will be kept alive. The problem occurs if you have circular references. Then the reference count will never reach 0, and the object(s) will never be deleted.So shared_ptr * still* require you to understand what you're doing and think about object ownership, as you always have to do in C++. But it simplifies some otherwise complex scenarios, where determining ownership is hard.But the real fix to your problem is to:minimize how much you allocate with new. Can the object instead be stored on the stack? Can the object be rewritten as a RAII class, so that a small wrapper object is allocated on the stack (or elsewhere with automatic storage duration), and which, through its constructors and destructors, manages a heap-allocated memory resource? Then, as long as that object exists, its allocated memory will be preserved, and once it is destroyed, it will delete its allocated memory.when you allocate objects with new, put them in one of the smart pointer classes. shared_ptr is popular because it is the one that comes closest to looking like a garbage collector, but it isn't, and if you treat it as one and use it as an excuse to not think about memory management, then it won't work. Understand all the smart pointer classes (scoped_ptr and auto_ptr in C++03, or unique_ptr replacing both in C++11, shared_ptr and weak_ptr), and use the one that best fits your scenario.think about ownership. Any time you allocate memory, you need to determine an owner, whose lifetime will control the lifetime of the memory allocation. Think about how long a lifetime your allocation needs, and have another object (whose lifetime is automatically managed, probably because it is on the stack) delete your memory when its destructor is called.There's no quick and easy fix. The way to handle memory management in C++ is to avoid memory management. Delegate it out to your objects. If you're calling delete in your own code, you're doing it wrong. Often, you don't even need new, but if you do, assign ownership to a smart pointer immediately, and let that call delete for you.As a rule of thumb, unless you're a library writer, you shouldn't write either new or delete. You should virtually never use raw pointers, and only when it is absolutely necessary, use smart pointers. Let your classes do the heavy lifting. Don't be afraid to put them on the stack, pass them by value, and let them handle their resources internally.

9155596	I have a JTable displaying rows from an SQL database. The table is relatively small (only 4 columns and up to 1000 rows). I would like to give the user the opportunity to edit any cells in the table but want to avoid restricting it so much so that they must use an edit dialog box (this makes for far easier error checking and validation but is less intuitive) I have tried a few different ways of controlling edit selections using the valueChanged method of my JTable but haven't had much luck.I would like each row to be edited and written to the database at the conclusion of editing. I would like that once a cell has been clicked to start the editing of that row, no other rows can be selected until the user has finished editing the row (other rows are grayed out). After editing each cell and pressing enter, the edit selection should jump to the next column in the same row.Can anyone give pointers on how I can achieve this?Edit - custom cell editor with table pointer seems to be a start}
9155689	The default renderer and editor is typically adequate for most data types, but you can define custom renderers and editors as needed.Addendum: I'm unfamiliar with the approach shown in your fragment. Instead, register a TableModelListener with your model, as shown below, and update the database with whatever granularity is warranted. See also How to Use Tables: Listening for Data Changes.Addendum: @kleopatra is correct about your TableCellEditor. One convenient way to notify listeners is to invoke the super implementation, as shown here. Note that the delegate invokes fireEditingStopped().
9156624	The behaviour you mention can be achieved by forcing your table to start editing again.First make sure you now yourRow and Column and that you add your own tablecelleditor that extands from the AbstractCellEditorthen add this to your stopCellEditing method:

9163188	From help(binascii).binascii is a builtin module. Your Python library seems to be installed in /usr/local/lib. So, I am guessing you have built it yourself. Are you sure, it built the binascii module successfully? That could be the error.
9164893	I don't know how to use maven at all. I've been developing for a couple years with Eclipse and haven't yet needed to know about it. However, now I'm looking at some docs () that suggest I do the following: "To include it within your project, just add this maven dependency to your build."How do I do this with my eclipse project? Please assume I know nothing about maven. I just figured out it might be installed on my computer by typing mvn on the command line, but that's seriously the extent of my knowledge. I would be happy to continue knowing nothing about maven if there is an equivalent, non-maven way of following these instructions with eclipse.Thanks!
9164994	You need to be using a Maven plugin for Eclipse in order to do this properly. The m2e plugin is built into the latest version of Eclipse, and does a decent if not perfect job of integrating Maven into the IDE. You will want to create your project as a 'Maven Project'. Alternatively you can import an existing Maven POM into your workspace to automatically create projects. Once you have your Maven project in the IDE, simply open up the POM and add your dependency to it.Now, if you do not have a Maven plugin for Eclipse, you will need to get the jar(s) for the dependency in question and manually add them as classpath references to your project. This could get unpleasant as you will need not just the top level JAR, but all its dependencies as well.Basically, I recommend you get a decent Maven plugin for Eclipse and let it handle the dependency management for you.
9165328	I didn't learn Maven yet, but what I know is:1) Maven is a system to download jars automatically and also automatically download jars they depend on.2) Repository is a web site which hosts jars and dependency information abotu them.3) Jboss repository is here: 4) Your jar is resteasy-jackson-provider.jar in this folder /org/jboss/resteasy/1.1.GA_CP01-brew/lib/5) I don't know how to deduce what it depends on :) So probably you can't avoid using Maven if there are a lot of dependencies.6) There is an add-on to Eclipse m2eclipse which can help to use Maven from this IDE. You can use it only for some of you jars, because it creates separate node in project explorer for Maven controlled jars.
9192767	We are parsing xml file that contains user informations such as name, age etc. But the users are from all over the world and we need different char-set in xml. For example, there is user with name "Sikl¢si" . If I set xml encoding UTF-8, c# xmldocument object throws an exception on xml load. I changed the encoding to iso-8859-9, it is working now. But, if we have another funny chars that is not covered by iso-8859-9, it will be problem again. What is the ultimate solution for this problem.
9192858	Make it UTF-32 which will cover most of them. For more info on UTF visit this.
9192888	The ultimate solution is to know what encoding was used to encode the file in the first place. An XML file should state what encoding it is using in the XML declaration (e.g. &lt;?xml charset="UTF-8" ?&gt;). If it doesn't, then the document should be UTF-8 or UTF-16 (and the difference between them can be detected automatically). Your XML parser should handle the encoding transparently based on the information in the XML file.If you are receiving documents that won't parse, then odds are that the problem is in how they are being generated in the first place. You should reject them and tell the submitted to fix the encoding.(Note that any Unicode encoding can handle just about any character you are likely to need (as well as a vast number you aren't). The problem is that the document isn't UTF-8, not that UTF-8 can't handle the characters being used).

9198987	Negative lookahead, which is what you're after, requires a more powerful tool than the standard grep. You need a PCRE-enabled grep.If you have GNU grep, the current version supports options -P or --perl-regexp and you can then use the regex you wanted.If you don't have (a sufficiently recent version of) GNU grep, then consider getting ack.

9204169	I know two coordinates of two vertices in a triangle (not aligned to an axis) and I'm attempting to calculate the coordinates of the third.I know the coordinates of A and B, the lengths of a and c, and that the angle C will always be a right angle. I believe there can only be two possible solutions for the coordinates of C; the one drawn above, and one with C reflected about the line c, approximately at C'. I'd like to calculate both positions.EDIT:The source of the triangle is from this diagram.I know the apex A, the centre of the circle B, the radius of the circle (a) and, from Pythag with (B - A), I know the length of c. I'm trying to find the points at which a line from the apex are at a tangent to each side of the circle, C and C'.This appears to be an answer to my problem; can anyone elaborate on 'Given two sides of a right triangle, it's easy to find the length and direction of the third side.'.
9204184	I know the coordinates of A and B, and the lengths of a and c. From this, I believe there can only be two possible solutions for the coordinates of CThis is not true. There are an infinite number of choices for the position of C, as you don't know the length of b.For example:If you connect C to A, you still maintain those known lengths....In order for this to be true, you would also need to know one of the angles (such as that it's a right triangle), or the length of b.

9205002	The xxxxxxx is just the version number of the file you downloaded.For example if you use the Linux 64-bit version, you will download the zip file mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.0.2.tgz.Then when you unzip it (tar xzf mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.0.2.tgz), you will get a folder called mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.0.2. The linux-x86_64-2.0.2 is what *xxxxxxx the quickstart guide refers to.So you do ./mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.0.2/bin/mongod, and ./mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.0.2/bin/mongo.

Also, you made the second part (number\\d+)? part of the match itself.Explanation of my solution:

Then the center point of this circle is c = (0.5 (xa + xb), 0.5 (ya + yb)) - just the midpoint of the A and B. The radius of the circle is r = sqrt( (xb - xa)^2 + (yb - ya)^2) / 2 - using pythagoras' theorem to get the length of the line and halving it. Then any point on the circle can be defined by p = c + (rcos(u), rsin (u)) for some angle u. There are 2 angles which give you the points p = A and p = B so these values of u are not good solutions. You can write out the equation and solve it for these 2 points to give you the values of u which you cannot use.
9215041	I am pretty confused trying to figure out the difference between a DB2 instance and a database instance. I did quite a bit of search online, but almost all comes up with 'database instances'.From what I have gathered, a database instance consists of the RDBMS software along with tables and other structures. My doubt is whether there is such a thing as a 'DB2 instance' or is it the same as a database instance?
9215075	DB2 is a Database from IBM. So "an instance of DB2" is a database instance, but a database instance is not always "an instance of DB2".
9215920	Check out the Information Center article on instances.Basically, you can have multiple instances of DB2 running on the same physical machine, and each of those instances can have their own separate databases, administration groups, tunings, etc.This applies to DB2 for Linux/Unix/Windows. I believe the rough equivalent would be "subsystem" in z/OS-land.

If not what is the next best step. I am trying to avoid a lot of manual queries from one table to another.Any direction is welcome, thank you.
9216945	Yes, a join is appropriate. The condition needs to be a compound condition that matches both the ip address and the time constraints.

9217284	Well, that question may sound silly, but...When I run my app in analyze mode or with instruments I get no possible (analyze mode) or memory (instruments) leaks. Does it mean that my app is 100% memory leaks free ?
9217309	you can assume it is in the best state now in which it could be.
9217404	No. For one thing, you'd have to run every possible execution path/state sequence in your app to definitively say that there are no leaks by simple testing. More importantly, true memory leaks, where you don't release memory but no longer have a reference to it are all the leaks instrument is able to detect. However, those are not the only similar problem you can create. You can also easily not discard data that you no longer actually need, causing memory to build up. This isn't a true leak, as you still have a reference to the data in question, it's just that you haven't released it and gotten rid of your reference to it. You can still find this kind of problem using the allocations instrument. It won't explicitly flag problems, but it will allow you to see if you're allocating lots of memory that you don't later release. On iOS in particular, it's important to make sure that you give up allocated memory when you no longer need it, or your app's memory usage will grow until the OS terminates your app.

9238374	This actually has nothing to do with the Market. If Android doesn't have enough resources to keep your app in memory, then it'll be removed from memory and it's process will be killed and onCreate will be called again the next time your app is started. What's probably happening is that Market is eating up all your device's memory when you install that way and causing the described behaviour.
9238402	if onStop() is being called, there is nothing to onResume. It is only called after onPause. And onRestart is only called if you code for it. See

9250281	Basicaly Yii comes with jQuery as client side library so you should use a jQuery selector to select your button and disable it. If you are having trouble selecting it you should add an ID to it.after that you could use jQuery to disable the buttonyou should place that code in the same view (all client side code should go in views) in a jQuery document ready function.Like stated, this isn't really a yii related question.
9253904	I am trying to use jquery delegate to bind to scroll events.htmlcssjavascriptjsfiddleWhy doesn't it work?
9253982	i think this may bind your scrollas requested by op:i change the css so child overflows and use jquery.scroll and that works, however there is no 'scroll' event like you have for jquery not that i know of anyway, hence the reason why bin, live etc can not be set for scroll and also why your deligate will not work
9254461	I have a form that is to be initialized with $_GET of the values postedThis will cause an error if the page is opened with an URL whose 'val' is not there ? I would like to check it first but I don't know how ?UPDATEMy problem isI am with an index page, after I fill in a form in the index page then submit, I will be directed to a confirm page, if I then press the button to confirm I will proceed further, if I press the button to re-edit the submitted information, I will be directed back to the index page but some information I entered previously in the text/textarea should not be deleted; that is why I use "index?info=something&amp;inf=somethingelse" etc. But If I leave this in the main page, the first run of the index page will cause an error in the form.
9254479	
9254648	I would use the empty method as well. Empty not only check if the value of the var you are looking but when you are looking inside an array it also deals with the case where that index isn't set or is set but has a null value.It's quite powerful as long as you are aware that it does all these things
9258525	I wonder whether for long loops we can take advantage of tail recursion for constexpr in C++11?
9258978	I've seen GCC perform this optimization. Here's an example:Works on -O2, crashes otherwise.Surprisingly, it is also optimizing this:I've check the disassembly of the non-conspexpr form and I can confirm that it is being optimized into a loop. But not this:So in conclusion, GCC will optimize into a loop the same it does for non-consexpr functions. Use at least -O2 and up.
9265835	I have a C++ DLL that exposes stuff via COM. I want to convert it to C++/CLI that exposes a managed interface. Ideally I just add CLI and convert interfaces one by one. So far I haven't succeeded in anything, so I'm looking for a specific strategy.More detail:A long time ago, I created an app using COM to communicate back and forth between C# and C++. I'm sick of COM, and the registration and the hoop jumping needed on the C++ side.I want to use C++/CLI, and get the whole thing working as managed code with the occasional call from C++/CLI to native libraries I'm using.Can anyone suggest a gentle migration path, such that I can have both CLI and COM going, and convert things over class by class testing as I go? Or something like that.To be clear: I currently have native C++ code defining and implementing COM interfaces. I have C# code using COM attributes to export classes. All this stuff gets registered for COM interop, and there are calls in both directions. I hope to switch the C++ to CLI and switch to managed classes in C++ rather than COM classes.Question updated for Ramhound: Anyway, I'm running into brick walls. Turning on /clr on a C++ dll gives me link errors from other stuff trying to connect to that C++ code. (Unreadable ATL/COM messages of the sort that drive me away from C++)
9265964	You may want to read through this, as it provides some different approaches and considerations involved: Here is a simple example of how to use interop in C++/CLI, where you could define a method or two and add more as you go:

9278722	I have a script to scrape a page. When the script runs, it takes 3 hours to complete. I want to build a button en when pressing it, the script must stop running.Someone an idea?
9278774	Use the Window.stop, it'll stop the page from processing
9278918	The script that is running is a webpage?Basically all you can do with the stop button, is send another request to the webserver (just stopping loading the webpage won't stop the request running on the server). This other request (being handled by another PHP thread/process) needs to let the first process know it needs to stop. One easy way of inter-process(/thread) communication is to have the second script create a file in the /tmp/ directory, and have the first process look for this file every now and then. If the first process sees that the file exists, it should abort processing and remove the file. Just to be a bit more robust, it should also delete the file on startup if it exists. Note: looking whether a file exists (in linux) in very fast. It will not hit the harddisk (because it will be cached). You won't even notice the extra delay until you really start doing it 1000+ times a second.Obviously this will only work if the second process loops in PHP. If the second process does a single SQL query that takes 3 hours, it can't look for the file every second or so. In that case you need to do something with signals, killing the first process, see .
9283717	I've wrote program, and compiled it for x64 and x86 platform in Visual Studio 2010 on Intel Core i5-2500. x64 version take about 19 seconds for execution and x86 take about 17 seconds. What can be the reason of such behavior?
9283862	64-bit normally is a little slower than 32-bit (for code that specifically doesn't take advantage of 64-bit features). One particular problem is that pointers are bigger, reducing the amount that can be held in the cache.
9283922	Short Answer: It's a compiler hiccup. x64 optimizer fail.Long Answer:This x86 version is very slow if SSE2 is disabled. But I'm able to reproduce the results with SSE2 enabled in x86.If you dive into the assembly of that inner-most loop. The x64 version has two extra memory copies at the end.x86:x64:The x64 version has a lot more (unexplained) moves at the end of the loop. It looks like some sort of memory-to-memory data-copy.EDIT:It turns out that the x64 optimizer isn't able to optimize out the following copy:This is why the inner loop has two extra memory copies. If you change the loop to this:This eliminates the copies. Now the x64 version is just as fast as the x86 version:Lesson Learned: Compilers aren't perfect.

9301857	Please, consider the following code. If I declare the exports field as follows:It gets compiled into:But as you probably already know I need the exports field to remain undeclared. In other words I need to somehow inform the compiler not to produce the var exports; statement.I know that I can hack around this like that:but that's just messy and very much seems like a defect, since the essence of CoffeeScript is to reduce the code noise.Is there a way or a better hack around this?
9302059	I'm assuming you "need the exports field to remain undeclared" because you're writing a Node.js module exports is already declared, yes? In that case this question and its top answer ought to go a long way toward helping you: CoffeeScript &amp; Global VariablesIn short you'll do something like this:Hope that helps!
9302132	I don't think you can assign directly to exports (in nodejs). I think your code should bein which case CS will assume module is already defined and will simply output

9303584	I have an n-sized collection of Rects, most of which intersect each other. I'd like to remove the intersections and reduce the intersecting Rects into smaller non-intersecting rects. I could easily brute force a solution, but I'm looking for an efficient algorithm.Here's a visualization:Original:Processed:Ideally the method signature would look like this:the output would be greater or equal to the input, where the output resolves the above visual representation.
9303620	what you're descrbing is the packing problem, have a look at wikipediait refers to this article describing an algorithm for packing rectangles in rectanglesthis is from the article: This article describes a fast algorithm to pack a series of rectangles of varying widths and heights into a single enclosing rectangle, with no overlap and in a way that minimizes the amount of wasted space in the enclosing rectangle.
9303894	Sweepline algoithms are good at processing intersections in 2D universes. I mean consider an horizontal line moving down from a rectangle edge to the next rectangle edge. The line hits a number of rectangles, forming the so-called active lists. The active list is kept updated at every move.By studying the ranges of abscissas along the horizontal line, you can detect the overlaps.A careful study of all configurations should allow you to split the rectangles the way you want in a single sweep, with lower complexity than brute force (closer to N^1.5 than to N^2).

9318648	Thou shall not call UI methdods dealing with UI from other threads than my UI thread. And your service is certainly not ibn UI thread. If you like to modify UI from service thread, you have to post async tasks to UI thread. For example with this:)
9318936	Your issue is that in your onStart method, your service hasn't actually started. The call is asynchronous. You need to wait for the service to become bound before you call any methods on this. There are many ways to do that, but the quickest would be to add the call mService.getCurrentLocation(); to the end of the onServiceConnected method. Note that this is going to run on the main thread of the app so don't do blocking operations on it.As you get further along, you may find that you need to kick off an async task from the end of teh connection to do all the work you want without affecting the ui. There are examples of that around the web.
9320911	By the rules in [implimits], an implementation is permitted to put a recursion depth limit on constexpr calculations. The two compilers which have complete constexpr implementations (gcc and clang) both apply such a limit, using the default of 512 recursive calls as suggested by the standard. For both of these compilers, as well as any other implementation which follows the standard's suggestion, a tail recursion optimization would be essentially undetectable (unless the compiler would otherwise crash before reaching its recursion limit).An implementation could instead choose to only count calls for which it could not apply a tail-recursion optimization in its recursion depth limit, or to not provide such a limit. However, such an implementation would probably be doing a disservice to its users, since it would be likely to either crash (due to a stack overflow) or fail to terminate on constexpr evaluations which recurse deeply or infinitely.With regard to what happens when the recursion depth limit is reached, Pubby's example raises an interesting point. [expr.const]p2 specifies that an invocation of a constexpr function or a constexpr constructor that would exceed the implementation-deﬁned recursion limits (see Annex B);is not a constant expression. Therefore, if the recursion limit is reached in a context which requires a constant expression, the program is ill-formed. If a constexpr function is called in a context which does not require a constant expression, the implementation is not generally required to attempt to evaluate it at translation time, but if it chooses to, and the recursion limit is reached, it is required to instead perform the call at runtime. On a complete, compilable test program:GCC says:and clang says:If we modify the code so that the evaluation is not required to occur at translation time:then both compilers accept it, and generate code which computes the result at runtime. When building with -O0, this code fails due to stack overflow. When building with -O2, the compilers' optimizers transform the code to use tail recursion and the code functions correctly (but note that this tail recursion is unrelated to constexpr evaluation).

9344575	I have a php application that inserts a data into MySQL, which contains a randomly-generated unique value. The string will have about 1 billion possibilities, with probably no more than 1 or 2 million entries at any one time. Essentially, most combinations will not exist in the database.I'm trying to find the least expensive approach to ensuring a unique value on insert. Specifically, my two options are:Have a function that generates this unique ID. On each generation, test if the value exists in the database, if yes then re-generate, if no, return value.Generate random string and attempt insert. If insert fails, test error is 1062 (MySQL duplicate entry X for key Y), re-generate key and insert with new value.Is it a bad idea to rely upon the MySQL error for re-trying the insert? As I see it, the value will probably be unique, and it seems the initial (using technique 1) would be unnecessary.EDIT #1I should have also mentioned, the value must be a 6 character length string, composed of either uppercase letters and/or numbers. They can't be incremental either - they should be random.EDIT #2As a side note, I'm trying to create a redemption code for a gift certificate that is difficult to guess. Using numbers and letters creates 36 possibilities for each character, instead of 10 for just numbers or 26 for just letters.Here's a stripped-down version of the solution I created. The first value entered in the table is the primary key, which is auto incremented. affected_rows() will equal 1 if the insert is successful:
9344630	Why not just use: "YourColName BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY" to ensure uniqueness?
9345152	Is it a bad idea to rely upon the MySQL error for re-trying the insert?Nope. Go ahead an use it if you want. In fact many people think if you check and if it doesn't exist then it's safe to insert. But unless you lock the table it's always possible that another process might slip in and grab the id.So go ahead generate a random id if it suits your purpose. Just make sure you test your code so it does properly handle dups. Might also be useful to log dups just to ensure your assumptions about how unlikey dups are to occur are correct.

9361172	I've got a table of numbers, that are ascending, but are not increasing in a pattern, let's call this table t1. In another table, t2 I've got another number, that may or may not be the same to a number in t1. What I want is the number from t1, that is the first smaller number to the one from t2. For example, if there are numbers 6000, 7000 and 8000 in t1, and the number in t2 is 7999 it would get the column with the number 7000.

9373004	I asked a more general question a minute ago: How to organize DI Framework usage in an application?, and the feedback I got was that I was using a Service Locator Pattern rather than true DI as is pointed out by Martin Fowler here: Actually, I read that article just the other day, but apparently haven't quite grasped it.So let's say I have the following code:interface ICardReader{ string GetInfo(); void SetDebugMode(bool value); void Initialize(string accountToken); void ShowAmount(string amount); void Close(); ICreditCardInfo GetCardInfo();}public class MagTekIPAD: ICardReader{ public ICreditCardInfo GetCardInfo() { var card = GetCardDataFromDevice(); // apparently the following line is wrong? var ccInfo = Inject&lt;ICreditCardInfo&gt;.New();  ccInfo.Track1 = MakeHex(card.EncTrack1); ccInfo.Track2 = MakeHex(card.EncTrack2); ccInfo.MagSignature = MakeHex(card.EncMP); ccInfo.MagSwipeKeySN = MakeHex(card.KSN); ccInfo.MagSignatureStatus = MakeHex(card.MPSts); ccInfo.MagDeviceSN = ipad.Serial; ccInfo.MSREncryptType = "MAGENSA_V5"; return ccInfo; } // Other implementation details here ...}In this example I could inject the dependency into the constructor—and I think that's the correct way to fix 'this' scenario. But what if I actually need to create an unknown number of the object in question (or are there any other legitimate reason I'd have a need to create the dependency on the fly in the class)?
9373220	As Fowler pointed out, Service Locator is the more direct approach and is less error prone.Some Dependency Injection frameworks require you to declare whether you are dealing with Singleton or they can have different lifetimes.

9381894	pow() returns a double, i think that's what you've missed
9381923	Without knowing the implementation of pow in your stdlib exactly, you cannot be absolutely sure thatreturns the correct result. 1.0/k introduces a small inaccuracy and that plus the inaccuracy of pow (unavoidable due to the representation of doubles) may just move the result of pow() past the integer threshold if n is a kth power or very close to one.An example using Haskell's (**), which does the same thing as pow() from math.h, but it might have a different implementation:It will however always be at least very close to the correct result, so you can use it as the starting point for a quick correction if necessary.where power(a,b) is an integer power function (could be round(pow(a,b)) for example, or exponentiation by repeated squaring). By raising r resp r+1 only to the k-1th power, overflow is avoided (except possibly if r is 1, you can deal with that special case easily if necessary by testing k &lt; 64 &amp;&amp; n &lt; (1ull &lt;&lt; k)).Of course the tests for the special cases and the fixup cost time and in almost all cases do nothing above floor(pow(n,1.0/k)), so it may not be worth it.

9385715	Consider unit testing a dictionary object. The first unit tests you might write are a few that simply adds items to the dictionary and check exceptions. The next test may be something like testing that the count is accurate, or that the dictionary returns a correct list of keys or values.However, each of these later cases requires that the dictionary can first reliably add items. If the tests which add items fail, we have no idea whether our later tests fail because of what they're testing is implemented incorrectly, or because the assumption that we can reliably add items is incorrect.Can I declare a set of unit tests which cause a given unit test to be inconclusive if any of them fail? If not, how should I best work around this? Have I set up my unit tests wrong, that I'm running into this predicament?
9386098	XCode 4 detects many possible memory leaks with Finch. This is because Finch is not properly naming its methods according to memory management guidelines.Methods that create objects must begin their method namewith "new", "alloc", "copy", or "mutableCopy".See:https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmRules.htmlFor example, decodeSampleAtPath should be renamed to "allocDecodeSampleAtPath".And anything that uses this method must then release it.There are many methods in Finch that don't do this, and they all should be fixed.

That might be an overly-artificial way to order your tests, but if you built up your test classes such that alphabetically/numerically-named pre-req methods came first you might accomplish what you want.I find myself writing a test method, firing just it to watch it fail, and then writing the code to make it pass. When I'm all done I can run the whole class and everything passes - it doesn't matter what order the tests ran in becuase everything 'works' becuase of the incremental dev I did.Now later on if I break something in the thing i'm testing who knows what all will fail in the harness. I guess it doesn't really matter to me - I've got a long list of failures and I can tease out what went wrong.
9386346	It's not as hard as it might seem. Let's rephrase the question a bit: If I test my piece of code which requires System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;T&gt;.Add to work, what should I do when one day Microsoft decides to break .Add on List&lt;T&gt;? Do I make my tests depending on this to work inconclusive?Answer to the above is obvious; you don't. You let them fail for one simple reason - your assumptions have failed, and test should fail. It's the same here. Once you get your add tests to work, from that point on you assume add works. You shouldn't treat your tested code any differently than 3rd party tested code. Once it's proven to work, you assume it indeed does. On a different note, you can utilize concept called guard assertions. In your remove test, after the arrange phase you introduce additional assert phase, which verifies your initial assumptions (in this case - that the add is working). More information about this technique can be found here.To add an example, NUnit uses the concept above disguised under the name Theory. This does exactly what you proposed (yet it seems to be more related to data driven testing rather than general utility): The theory itself is responsible for ensuring that all data supplied meets its assumptions. It does this by use of the Assume.That(...) construct, which works just like Assert.That(...) but does not cause a failure. If the assumption is not satisfied for a particular test case, that case returns an Inconclusive result, rather than a Success or Failure.However, I think what Mark Seemann states in an answer to the question I linked makes the most sense: There may be many preconditions that need to be satisfied for a given test case, so you may need more than one Guard Assertion. Instead of repeating those in all tests, having one (and one only) test for each precondition keeps your test code more mantainable, since you will have less repetition that way.

9465565	We are planning to use IBM Web Experience Factory for our future enhancements. From the project management point of view we are thinking of using Maven. But due to no online help available for using both the things together we are not able to move ahead.Please let me know if anyone can provide inputs.
9466864	For the point Maven i don't understand how you get to say "no online help available" ...despite the official books  you can read many things online on  furthermore there some other books which can be bought via Amazon or take a look at articles.html for an overview.

9475997	I have a programming competition tomorrow and I have a quick question:In Java, if you would pass an object in a parameter for a method, you actually got not a copy of the object, but the actual object.Is it the same as C#?If I do that will I basically make a pointer to inputArray, instead of having a copy?Just a quick question, thanks!
9476023	In regard to your basic question in relation to Java Yes. More generally Yes and no. Reference types (classes) are passed by reference which is like a single pointer. For something that can truly modify references outside the caller you should use the ref keyword even on reference types. This is similiar to a double pointer (assuming we are referring to pointers as they work in C for our pointer analogies).In the above example if we passed str without using the ref keyword we would reassign the local reference of s instead of the original reference of str. By passing our reference by reference we can modify the original reference outside of the function as well. References themselves are still copied by value (but the copied reference still points to the same value) without the ref keyword.For practical usage in the scenario you are describing the modern C# idiom usually uses lists and they will likely be much faster to use as far as programming in your competition:Working on the original input list would modify objects through the reference so you would be affecting the original values outside of the method whereas the templList is a copy - Lists are very convenient.Furthermore you can convert them back to Arrays using .ToArray()
9476024	To assign something different to your array you'd want to have the parameter use the 'ref' keyword.

Even if unsigned and insecure?I'd really love to know whether it is possible at all before setting up a server side process, however even if the answer is "no, you can't do it" please give some motivation on why the only way to know the current page should be a server side script, what security violations could possibly arise if Facebook was offering a way to know the current page in an insecure way.

9506342	Ok, I need my program to validate user entered data. If that data is invalid, the program needs to skip almost all of my code and get to the end of my while loop to ask if the user would like to proceed with calculating another loan. My professor has not provided us with a method of doing this and all the information ive found on the internet is not specific enough to help me. Once again, I need the code after the validation to be skipped without exiting the program and go to the end of the loop where I ask the user if they want to calculate another loan. Here is my code thus far.
9506446	continue is maybe one of the worse feature of java, with the break keyword (except in switch statements). It leads to jigsaw code where you have to find out where the code jumps. One continue may be practical but it gets very hard to change the code it produces (think about adding an inner loop..), and 2 continues will make you crazy.You can always avoid using continue, there is always another solution. Same for break. Here, why don't you just use some kind of That's easy, simple, clear and even better when you have a separate method that contains processing.Also, in your case, that is tied to robustness, you could provide a process() method that throws an exception if the data entered is not valid. This makes it even more clear that there is a "normal" program behavior and a bunch of strange cases you handle as errors.then your main loop becomes
9507455	I've skimmed through your code and to be honest, I don't know much about loans and the calculations associated with it.As you're clearly still learning the basics, a simple solution by the looks of it would be to take out:And put it in its own method called for example:So when you return you will go to the repeat dialogue.

9530888	You can't really do that. C# is less outgoing about its arrays, and prevents you from doing C-like manipulations. This is a good thing.You have various options:Create a 1D array and copy your 2D row to it.Use a jagged array - an array of arrays, which is more like what C lets you do.Have an array_processing overload that takes a 2D array and a row number.If you really want to access a 2D row as a 1D array, you should create a 'RowProxy' class that will implement the IList interface and let you access just one row:Use a lambda expression that will lose the array semantics, but is rather cool:You can use row_5_accessor as a function, row_5_accessor(3) will give you ClientId[5, 3]

And another really important item to remember is that you'll need your app secret to parse the signed request, and exposing that critically secret item in your client-side could will be extremely risky!If your requirements say you can neither auth the user nor process the signed request server-side, then you won't be able to get the page id client side.For security's sake, process the signed_request server-side. :)Happy coding!

For number 61, I have to put into bucket 1.I planned to use a multidimensional array to do this. So I create a 2-dimenional array, which nrows is 10 ( for 0~ 9) and ncolumns is 999999 ( because I don't know how large will the list be):Then I created one node call a. In this node a, there is a value 50. To find out which bucket I want to put it in, I calculate "left" and I got 0. So I want to put this a-> value into bucket 0. But now I am stuck. How do I put this value into the bucket? I have to use a pointer array to do this.I thought for a long time but still couldn't find a good way to do it. So please share some ideas with me. thank you!
9559912	There is a much easier way of doing this, and instead of radix*nkeys space you only need an nkeys-sized buffer.Allocate a second buffer that can fit nkeys keys. Now do a first pass through your data and simply count how many keys end up in each bucket. You now can create a radix-sized array of pointers where each pointer is to the start of that bucket in the output buffer. Finally, the second pass though the data moves the keys. Every time you move a key, increment that bucket pointer.Here's some C code to make into C++:But I may have misunderstood the question. If you are doing something a little different than radix sort, pleas add some details.

9569242	I've been playing around with the Tornado chat demo. At a casual glance it seems like the new_messages method is not thread safe - it seems like items might get added to the waiters array while that same array is being iterated in the for loop.Is this demo not thread safe? Or, is it thread safe simply because the Python set object is itself thread-safe? Are Python set objects thread safe? I seem to find conflicting opinions on this question (and the word set is demonically difficult to search for effectively in Google!)Bonus points - why is the waiters array set to a new set at the conclusion of the iteration instead of emptying the set?
9569484	Hi following code will help you in reading plist from NSDocumentDirectory:

9573195	Is there a way you can invoke a member function of a base class upon a class derived from it?I have a practice midterm, and I suspect no, because how would the Base class know about the Derived, but I am not sure.
9573263	First of all, do you mean methods on an object, or static class methods?Secondly, the answer is: it depends what the object you're invoking the method call on is. This is the nature of polymorphism: if your object is of type 'Derived', then even if it has been cast to a 'Base' the method call will still invoke the Derived version of func.Is that what you were asking?
9573294	Is there a way you can invoke a member function of a base class upon a class derived from it?Not sure exactly what you mean by this, but given your Base and Derived classes you can do the following. Just make sure you use a reference or pointer, not pass-by-value because of the slicing problem.Call Base::func() from within Derived::func():Call Base::func() explicitly on a Derived object: I [...] am wondering if you could do something like Base::func(Derived d)As others have pointed out, you can do this using a forward declaration:However, you won't be able to define the Base::func(Derived&amp;) directly in the class definition since you need to finished defining Base and to define Derived first.

9577932	There are no threads involved in Tornado applications by default. Tornado is an event based system, so there is only one execution path. The thing that you will need to figure out about tornado is at what moments you yield execution back to the IOLoop.While the GIL does protect against a class of thread errors, you still can write applications that access and modify the data outside the access path of the program.

9593787	Oftentimes, you have a problem where property A can be either true or false, property B also either true or false, and so on. We want to test every combination of A being true while B being false, and so on. So for example we might need the following list:In Haskell or Python, this can be done by a list product function.My question is, what's the simplest and/or quickest way to generate this? I have always done this by converting a number to binary, then converting the binary into an array. But this seems cumbersome because decimal to binary conversion isn't completely trivial, and also we need to worry about padding the binary with leading zeroes to fill up the array properly.I have implemented and re-implemented this kind of function in different contexts enough times to wonder, is there a way simple enough that you can implement it from scratch when necessary -- without really having to think?
9593895	I'm not exactly sure of the code but something along these lines should work.I'm iterating through the numbers 0 to 7 (000 to 111 respectively) and isolating each bit to identify the boolean value.

9603029	What do you mean by a "signed" hexadecimal value? Do you want something like "-e0"? If so, what would that mean? The sign is already represented in the hexadecimal display, since it shows all the bits and that's all the information that's in the number.

9613749	Sounds like the time range would simply be an attribute of whichever primary object you are working with, as such you could add a separate table to store the time range data, something like:-- Update --In hindsight I would probably abstract hour from the column names in favor of time, just in case you need to consider alternative time frames. And day should be day_id, even though its a static list, I always like going with ints in this situation.

Here, i create the date variables:Then i insert it to a mysql table with the column Datatype of bigint.When i then, later on, when i need to echo the date, i use this code:But istead of echo'ing the date in the format D/M/Y H:i, it echo'es the date in the format of m/d/y H:i.Can anyone explain why this is happening, and how to fix it?Thank you in advance,Adam
9616843	You can pull a date format from your mysql database and then when converting to a php variable you can use:Where $result is your mysql query result and "Date" is the name of the column. However I am unsure of using this method with the time. --EDIT--link:
9617007	First, is quite funny way of assigning time() frunction result to $datestrto variable. Next, you don't need that variable either, as you just can use unix_timestamp() mysql function in the insert query.Now to your question. istead of echo'ing the date in the format D/M/Y H:i, it echo'es the date in the format of m/d/y H:i. double-check your syntax. there is a typo somewhere.
9618379	I cannot for the life of me remember how to do this. This program opens a file then reads the file. All I would like it to do is print out the contents it has just read.
9618413	printf accepts %s format to print a C-string. However, by default it requires that string to have a null-terminator (0x0 ASCII code). If you are sure it was read by the call to read then you can do this:However, you cannot be sure. Because you don't even check how many bytes were read... or for error code.So you have to fix your code first.Once you are done checking for errors and know how many bytes were read, you can do this:Good luck!

9618487	Everything is perfect. I haven't seen any issue. Keep break points everywhere and debug it.
9620197	Your code looks fine, which suggests the problem is somewhere we can't see. My guess is here:Have you embedded your modal view controller in a navigation controller? If so, destinationViewController gives you the navigation controller, not the AddClassViewController. Check what class addClassVC actually is in the debugger. If it is a navigation controller, no problem, you just need to get to your actual VC using the .viewControllers property. On several lines to make it simpler to understand:You can do it in fewer lines but it's a mess of casting and nested brackets, which is harder to debug.

Now I started using Linq2Sql and Entity Framework.When using ADO.Net application my client should have SQL Server in their system to access the database file.But some one has told me that Linq2Sql and Entity Framework doesn't need SQL Server on the client, it just need the .mdf file to access the database.Because in LinqToSql we give the connection as the path of .mdf fileIs it true?Please explain me all the things.
9629319	I highly doubt that you can directly use ,mdf file without SQL Server because Database transactions are not simply file reading and writing that can be done directly against .mdf file.LINQ to SQL queries are first converted into SQL and then executed.

As a result, we don’t need to worry about abusing our expensive connection external resources.To begin working with the DataContext, create an instance of a DataContext object passing it the connection string for our database.The DataContext also handles managing our mappings and provides a vital resource—the ability to fill a collection of objects from the database. It fills the object into a specialized generic collection type called a Table&lt;>. To get a table of books from the DataContext object, we call dataContext.GetTable():Fetching books using LINQ TO SQL:With this example, we’ve effectively eliminated any custom ADO.NET code thatwe’d have otherwise needed to write. However, we’re fetching all of the fieldsregardless of whether we need to use them.

9629841	Try inserting 100 at a time instead of 1,000 at a time. That should cut your background thread's memory usage by quite a bit.If your records are coming from the server as XML, don't use a DOM parser; it is a memory hog. Use a SAX, StAX, or pull parser instead.Finally, be sure that you aren't keeping references to objects that you don't need once the records are inserted.

In your code, you do not handle the exceptions with try catch blocks. Thus, when an exception is raised, the server will send it back to the client but most of the exceptions are NOT serializable, so they cannot be transported back to the client and this is why you get the mentioned error.
9643498	I have implemented an application with image view in my application i would like to implement when user move the image right side then i would like to get the next acitvity.How can i write an event or any other code for move the image just right side?I have used am imageView code as:Please any body help me...

9645059	So, if i understood you correctly, you want to move an ImageView across the screen, drag it, and when you hit a certain spot with it you want to start another activity?If so, you could try and use the code below...which let's you drag your imageview across the screenJust add an onTouchListener to the imageView you're trying to slide (move/drag)Then add this code to handle the Touch eventsThe above should drag your imageview accross the screen.You can also implement in the MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE event .... to limit the movement of the ImageView accross the screen. So check the new coordinates of your finger across the screen and check if they are out of bounds. If so, then do nothing. If they aren't out of bounds, then change the left and upper margins of the ImaveView. Also, on the MotionEvent.ACTION_UP event, check to see if the left margin of the ImaveView is over a predefined limit (which means the user slided the imageView over you intended position). If so, you can continue doing whatever you want, which means starting an activity. OR, if you don't want to open the activity while the user is dragging, not only after he has removed his finger from the imageView, then just do that if () i've written under the MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE event. Insert there the interval you want, so when the imageView is dragged inside that interval, the activity starts. If you're confused, please ask :) It's very late here, and i'm tired, so i might have not explained it properly :D
9645775	is this correct way of doing.i am a newbie pythonwhen i run this i get NameError: name 'self' is not defined ???
9645827	The variable self (the first argument to a class method - you can use any name for it) is meant to refer to a class instance (also called an object). You use self where self is not defined, right out in the class where no specific object is yet known.When the code queueLock = threading.lock() ... etc, is executed you are not in a class object (instance) but in the context of the class, so your lock will be the same for all objects of the class. About send_queue, it's defined and known to all objects via the class, so you do not need to use self. to access it.If you want some code to be executed at instance creation put it in __init__.
9645857	Please make sure that the send_queue function is part of the main class. The self is like this pointer in C++ and needs to be associated with a class. The send_queue function should be indented along with the main class

9649156	I am using Eclipse to develop an Android board game.I have developed the UI in an Android project.On the other hand, I have developed the AI in a regular Java project, because I wanted to be able to test it without all the constraints of the Android emulator (I didn't find any other way to run the code using my Windows JVM).Now comes the times when I want to 'join' both projects (which work fine independently), that is to use the AI Java classes from the UI.This is what I have tried:In my Android project Properties > Projects References, I ticked the Java project.This allows me to build without error the Android project (which instantiates an AI object).But it fails at runtime with this error:What would be the correct way to include the AI Java Project into my Android Project ? (NB: I still want to be able to develop and test the AI as a regular Java app, so I think using a jar or copying all the sources to the Android Project would not suit my needs)EDIT:I was hoping that the new ADT v17 would solve the problem, but it didn't. I have tried virtually every option available to include a project in my Android project:Adding or linking a source folderAdding a Project (Java Build Path > Projects tab)Adding a Class Folder or a Library (Java Build Path > Library tab)Ticking all the previously imported projets/libraries as ExportedThe only way that allows compiling and running without error is adding the JAR of the Java Project to the Android project build path.
9649211	Don't add it to the project references area, instead go into the Android pane (in the Project Properties), scroll down to the bottom, and add it under Libraries.This sometimes works but sometimes produces bizarre Eclipse issues (not sure why), in which case copying the jar directly into the project seems to work best.
9650853	Projects References only add the dependent project source code (your AI project) as a soft (perhaps weak is a more accurate word) reference, your AI project is not added into you Android Project Build path. so the actual ai.jar is not exported into the final apk when Eclipse build your app.You should add AI project into Android project build path:Right-click on your android project, select Build Path - Configure Build Path, in Projects tab (Required projects on the build path), add your AI project here.Then in Order and Export tab (Build class path order and exported entries), tick your newly added AI project appeared int the list.Step 2 is probably optional, this should add AI project as a reference in Android project and export the ai.jar to final.apk when Eclipse build your Android project.Update from ADT 17.0.0: Android Dev Team just release SDK r17 with ADT 17.0.0, which claims to handle this use cases properly now: Eclipse specific changes  The dynamic classpath container called “Library Projects” has been renamed to “Android Dependencies” as it now contains more than just Library Projects.  The container will now also be populated with Java-only projects that are referenced by Library Projects. If those Java projects also reference other Java projects and/or jar files they will be added automatically (jar files referenced through user libraries are supported as well).  Important: this only happens if the references are set to be exported in the referencing project. Note that this is not the default when adding a project or jar file to a project build path. Library Projects (and the content of their libs/*.jar files) is always exported. This change only impacts Java-only projects and their own jar files.  Again, duplicates (both projects and jar files) are detected and removed.More in this link.
9652111	I am trying to loop through every process in a /proc utility I'm writing (a kernel module in /fs/proc). The problem is, I am only seeing processes in the root namespace. I'm trying to use the macro for_each_process from sched.h.I can type ps in a shell and see plenty of processes, but my for_each_process loop doesn't see them. What gives?Note: I am wondering if it has something to do with rcu_read_lock? I'm afraid to put an rcu_read_lock and I don't know where it should go. The trouble is, the documentation I read seems to say that in a preemptible kernel (mine is), it is illegal to sleep inside of rcu_read_lock. I need to call down_read(mmap_sem) which I am afraid will sleep. So that means I can't use rcu_read_lock?
9652158	for_each_process is a kernel layer function, and it's really not how you're supposed to loop over processes in unix. Something a lot simpler, such as this (python, easily implemented in other languages), might be the solution you want.
9653461	I am developing a PHP application that deals with a large MySQL database and now I am starting to go over my memory limit (64mb) in PHP because of the database queries. I was wondering what the best way is to prevent (and if not, stop) memory exhaustion in PHP and MySQL?
9653534	Can you post examples of the queries you run on your database and how you then want to use that for your webpage?It is very rare to need 64Mb of data from the mysql server to generate a page. Do you do the following to limit the data received:Use LIMIT statements to extract only the first linesSpecify in SELECT the columns that you really need (instead of SELECT *)Be as specific as possible in your WHERE clauseUse mysql_free_result to free up resources between two different SQL requests (in case you run several of them)?

9661981	What all web servers support HTML 5 content? Do they have some config that allows to switch between HTML versions based on client browsers?
9662010	You can determine the users browser agent in PHP or some other web-cgi, look it up in some giant array to determine if it's HTML5 compatible, and serve them a HTML5 page if so, HTML4 if not.In pure HTML, browsers ignore elements they don't understand, but will treat it like it's not there, so you can use that for SOME tricks, but it's mostly done by serving a different page for HTML4/HTML5 browsers.
9662047	HTML 5 was explicitly designed to degrade gracefully in older browsers that do not understand it. As such, there's no need to serve different versions. You may or may not have to put in some client-side Javascript-based shims for some of the more advanced HTML 5 features, but there's no need to have several versions of the same HTML document.

9745448	In my JavaScript I detect images that are on the page, amongst them those that are set as background images via "background-image:url" or "background" shorthand format.I'd like to get the Image Element associated with that image, so I can check it's width/height and natural width/height.Since the browser has already loaded these background images, is there are way to get the Image Element (or similar) associated with the loaded images so I can check the width/height and natural width/height.
9745489	You can loop through document.getElementsByTagName("img") and check the src attribute. If it matches your image url list, then you have the element.To get the ones with the CSS background-image, you can loop through ALL the elements in the document and check if they have that style (el.style["background-image"]) or similar.

Currently I have this code that adds a td to my table,
9746117	You shouldn't append table cells directly into the table. Table cells goes into table rows.Get the last row in the table, and check how many cells there are in it. If there are four cells already you need to create a new table row and append to the table, then add the cell to that row. Otherwise you can add the cell to the existing row.

9749013	I do not have much experience with C++ and I have a question regarding the following lines from Qt documentation here :  ( Lines 4-6 after the comment at the top )Since QAction, QMenu and QPlainTextEdit are library classes of Qt ( clicking on them leads to their documentation pages), shouldn't they be included using '#include ' ? What purpose does just declaring them with the keyword 'class' serve ? As far as I think , the compiler will think of it as a completely new class, having nothing to do with the library class QAction.However, the 'mainwindow.cpp' file (  ) does not contain any definition of class QAction, though its objects are being used in the code.What is going on here ?Edit : Further explanation of the problemLook into the createActions method of class MainWindow (  ). Here objects of class QAction are being created but nowhere can I find a definition of QAction class.
9749132	Declaring a class, as opposed to defining it, is sufficient to make the compiler aware of the fact that a certain name refers to a type, and that allows you to use the type in certain settings. Specifically, a declared but not-yet-defined type is an incomplete type, and you can use incomplete types in several ways:In a function declaration, the function's return type and argument types may be incomplete (but of course not in the function's definition).*If T is an incomplete type, then T* and T&amp;, as well as their CV-qualified versions, are complete types.So you can write the following:You can declare a class, or any type for that matter, as often as you like. The only thing that has to be unique is the definition (whence the "One Definition Rule").*) With one exception: void is always incomplete, and you are allowed to return a void type by not returning anything at all.
9749206	I was just working on that example a few days ago. So here is the conclusion why I think you need those:I'm guessing that if you'd look in the .pro file you'd see a line that's like:So the thing is you're telling the Qt translator and the compiler that you're using the QtGui and QtCore modules, and in those modules you have the QAction etc defined. So as a "hack" (since their IDE isn't able to detect that automatically until a later stage in the compilation process) you pre-declare the classes in order to avoid any errors during the compilation stage. In the end the Qt inserts the modules and everything works fine.This gave me a headache the first time i did that as well but this was the only logical explanation I could get.If you don't pre-declare the class you'll get an error saying that it can't find any reference to the class etc.EDIT:In light of your recent update, i suggest that you go to YouTube and search for a user under the nick: voidrealms. He has decent C++ Qt video tutorials with explanations, and there he also shows the QMenu, QAction etc. He has 150+ videos on Qt C++ programming and covers everything from the basic Hello World all the way to network programming and even further... Check him out, he has other tutorials as well

9752790	I'm pretty new to Objective-C, as you may gather, and until recently, I hadn't really understood the need for all this AutoRelease malarky. I think that's mostly because I've started Objective-C with ARC, and haven't had any exposure to doing retains and release.Anyway, my understanding now is that pre-ARC, if you created an object and needed to return a pointer to it as the returning object of the method/function, you would need to autorelease it, because you are unable to do the "[obj release]" after doing "return obj;"Worrying about retains and releases isn't an issue with ARC. Does this mean that in our own code, there is really point in creating our own autoreleased objects? Ie, doing [[[Class alloc] init] autorelease]? From what I've gathered, we should still setup autorelease pools, but only because other frameworks or libraries may still return autoreleased objects, but we no longer need to explicitly create autoreleased objects ourselves - is this a fair understanding?Thanks,Nick
9752844	When using ARC, you do not want to do any memory management yourself. Specifically you will not be calling release and auto release because it does it all for you. In fact, the compiler should probably complain if you try to manage memory yourself.Instead of [[[Class alloc] init] autorelease]; you'll just call [[Class alloc] init];I recommend reading this blog post for some really good background on ARC and memory management in general.
9753018	Well, your understanding is quite correct. With ARC we do not release or autorelease any more. Just have to make sure that we assign nil (or some other reasonable value) to any reference to objects, which we do not need any more. In the worst case we could still constantly consume additional memory but the memory cannot leak any ore. And yes, we still maintain autorelease pools for the sake of using framework libraries (linked ones) that may not use ARC. To answer your question between the lines about the purpose of autorelease. This applies to non-ARC project only, of course. In the good old days Objective-C did not offer any reference counting but its retain counting. Any allocated memory of objects, that are not retained (or have a retain count of 0) is considered free and may soon be claimed and used by other objects. This means that every object needs to be retained after its allocation, assuming that you want to keep it around. When the object is not used any more then you need to release it. This comes with two risks. Well, alloc does retain it once automatically. 1) You may forget to release an object that is unused. In the worst case you may even loose all references to an object that stays in memory for ever since. 2) You may still refer to an object hat has been released already and then try accessing it which will most likely end in an BAD_EXC exception. All this can be quite annoying. In order to get rid of some of these obligations for objects that don't stay around very long, the autorelease was invented. For temporary objects only you alloc it (release-count = 1) and autorelease it. That means that the object will be automatically released (retain count reduced by 1) within the next autorelease circle. But the object remains allocated for your method while it is being executed. Typically the reference variable would be a local one. Sample: And that not required any more when using ARC.

According to my code, the new view controller is created already, so the crash occurred in UINavigationController.It doesn't look like the fault of the code I wrote.

9756074	not sure why you would want to do something like that, but the above should work
9756198	Lets say the variable $text holds the data from your question.Let's analyse the regular expression /set\('(.*?)'/:/ is the delimiter.set\(' and ' are the strings set(' and ', respectively..*? is the least amount of (arbitrary) characters between the two aforementioned strings.1As a result, this regular expression matches:$this-&gt;validation-&gt;set('username','username','trim');To store all the strings you need in the array $matches[1], we can use the function preg_match_all.It suffices to call preg_match_all("/set\('(.*?)'/", $text, $matches).1 See also: Regex Tutorial - Repetition with Star and Plus - Laziness Instead of GreedinessExample code:

Here is my first step:I am trying create my own library for a project and the below is the initial structure.I used immediately invoked function expression here to initialize my variable. In this case it is fooLib.I am not sure if I should do some other things to make window.fooLib more safe. I mean it can be overridden by any other code which will run after my code if I understand JavaScript correctly.What are your thoughts?
9767272	I am not sure if I should do some other things to make window.fooLib more safe. I mean it can be overridden by any other code which will run after my code if I understand JavaScript correctly.You could try making window.fooLib a local variable instead. Using closures and nested functions one can emulate a namespace where you can put all your data instead of putting it into the global scope or attaching it to window object:See Javascript Closures: Encapsulating Related Functionality for more details.
9767789	If you want to prevent overwriting your variables, you may use Object.defineProperty() with writable:false, configurable:false. In your case:Still, there is no good reason for that. It would need EcamScript 5.1 to work, and there are no shims around; maybe something with getters/setters to prevent overwriting with the = operator.But also, there should be no need to make your library un-overwritable. Just don't use code on your site that overrides the lib. Or maybe someone even wants to overwrite your functions with another, better lib with the same interface?If the question is about a library to be shared, with possible namespace conflicts to others, you may have a look at jQuery.noConflict.
9769687	You cannot calculate the values in pixels without effectively setting CanContentScroll="False".To know the size in pixels you would need to create the containers of all the items and sum up the heights of all the containers. To do that you will need to generate all the containers first. Which would mean that you effectively lost virtualization and effectively set CanContentScroll="False". In that case why use CanContentScroll="True" in the first place? What Nikolay's code tries to do is take on the burden of doing yourself what CanContentScroll="False" does without giving you the smooth scrolling that you would have otherwise gained.More importantly what problem does the physical offset solve that you cannot solve with the logical offset if you know that CanContentScroll="true" always?
9770213	I am experiencing memory leaks linked to NSMutableArray's in a project configured to use ARC, which I thought was supposed to handle these things for you.The following code is triggering leaks of NSNumbers:Running the last line gives the following in the debugger: objc[1106]: Object 0x765ffe0 of class __NSCFNumber autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking - break on objc_autoreleaseNoPool() to debugAside from that, the object appears to be correctly added to the mutable array,Am I doing something obvious wrong?Note: There is one class in the project which I could not get to work with ARC, and so I excluded it from ARC using the compiler flag -fno-objc-arc. However, the leaks are occurring in other classes that are using ARC. Not sure if that is related.Many thanks for your help.
9770302	Very likely you have defined the NSMutableArray as a static variable. When you do that, you fall outside the bounds of any autorelease pool, since static definitions are activated outside of any runloop. ARC is not magically, it simply automates memory management calls within the framework of the existing retain/release framework and so cannot help in those cases.The solution is to initialize the static variable somewhere in a class so that your mutable array is built within the runloop.
9772460	I'm looking for the best practice here.I need to store 10 variables of information, in a certain format:using Javascript. I was thinking about using cookies. My scenario is as follows:The user would be in Salesforce.com and they would enter the customer's information into a record. They would then click a button get a quote. The button, using JS, would write the Salesforce fields to a temp file (cookie maybe). From there the other MS application would pick up that file and read in the values.How would you guys do that? Thanks for the time.
9772580	You can add a thread/task to the MS Application that watches for changes in the directory whee the cookie is created. When you detect a new file that meets your requirements you can act on it. You will need to use DirectoryInfo for this approach.You can also create and windows or webservice that the application listen to and can pass the data this way from the web app.
9772753	The browser will not allow you to write files, generally speaking. For this, you'd have to use a mechanism to get out of the security sandbox, such as a signed Java applet.
9774315	In Java would there be any performance impact in using post increment vs pre increment operator?Example:
9774471	A performance question only makes sense in a context where the functional behavior is identical (since, if the functionality is different, a correct behavior is superior to a minutely-faster one), so I'm assuming that you're referring to a situation where the value of the expression is not used? That is, where the only purpose of the expression is to increment i? In such a situation, the answer is no: no performance difference, and in fact, no difference whatsoever. I just compiled this class:and computed the MD5 checksum of the resulting Foo.class; and, similarly for a version with ++i instead. They had the same checksum, indicating that the two versions were compiled into the exact same bytecode, and would therefore perform literally identically.(Naturally, this could, in theory, depend on the compiler. A different compiler might decide to compile i++ differently from ++i even in a context where they're equivalent. But I doubt that, and it's really not worth worrying about even if it the case.)

E.g., given the following:I would expect the following (not exhaustive):I imagine I could eventually work this out, but someone must have solved it already for things like the type inference in Arrays.asList(...). Can anyone point me to an algorithm, or better yet, some existing utility code?ETA: I know about the reflection APIs. It's the algorithm (or an implementation of such an algorithm) I'm looking for.ETA: And I know it's a DAG. Thank you. You're very clever.ETA: On topological sorting (in re EJP's answer): the topological sort algorithms I'm familiar with require you to either:start from "root" nodes n with no incoming edges (i.e., in this scenario, presumably Object and all interfaces without superinterfaces -- which one would have to examine the whole set, plus all superclasses/superinterfaces, to collect) and process all edges (n, m) (i.e., all m extends/implements n, information which again one would have to examine the whole set to collect), orstart from "leaf" nodes m with no outgoing edges (i.e., in this scenario, all classes/interfaces m for which no class k extends/implements m exists, which again one would have to examine the whole set to collect) and process all edges (n, m) (i.e., all class/interfaces m extends/implements -- which information we do have).It's possible one or the other of these multi-pass algorithms (okay, presumably #2) is the most efficient way to do this, but it's certainly not trivially obvious. It's also entirely possible there's a one-pass topological sort algorithm I'm not familiar with, or that I've simply got these algorithms wrong, but in that case, again, "it's basically a kind of topological sort" does not immediately lead one to the answer.
9797498	It's basically a kind of topological sort: see e.g. Knuth Art of Computer Programming vol I, #2.2.3, or Sedgewick. And re your comments, no you don't need to start with vertices, it just works on a set of ordered pairs, and produces a partial ordering. The Unix tsort utility is an implementation of this.EDIT There seems to be some opinion here that instead of just identifying the algorithm concerned, which I note that nobody else has yet done in the years since this question was posted, I should give yet another exposition of this algorithm when many already exist, notably in the places I have cited. I do not agree. I'm wondering whether anybody would expect a reproduction of Knuth or Sedgewick or indeed C.A.R. Hoare if the question was about Quicksort.

9815502	Present Scenario :I have a set of classes that all take a common argument context in constructor, and all the classes inherit from a common base.Usage in main:Problem:Is there a tricky way possible to supply context to all the classes implicitly ?We have a common base class, but I don't see a obvious way to let it set the context for all the classes.It can be assumed that I want to keep context common to all my class instances.Just a random thought - Can meta class help somehow ?I know it seems silly, but I just want to get rid of the redundancy in some way, so that I can set a global context somehow and concentrate on my objects.Please suggest some way around ?** Update to Question ** I can-not set a context in the base class, since this is to be used in a web application. So, many pages with different context will be using the class structure. So, If I set a context in base then it will conflict to the context that will be set by another instance of webpage that will use the same base. Since, in a web-application all the above classes will be in memory common to all pages.
9815576	You should define context as a class attribute of base. Modifying your example would be:All A, B and Z instances shares the same context property.
9815583	Edit: If you don't want to / can't use a class variable, your best bet is to use a factory function. Either make it a static method on the base class, or a module level function.Alternatively, and I don't know if this works in your situation, just use a module level global variable:In addition to the advice to use class variables from the other answer, I advise you to copy the context onto the instances, so that you can later change the context without affecting already created instances.
9820825	Hi am am working on android.I have a layout which was used in every activity.I mean I have a layout which has footer and header.On each activity, header and footer same and has same actions.I want to use a general layout for header and footer.I mean in a activity, I will put the content area layout to general layout.I find someting but not enough.How can I do this? Is there a dummy docuument for do this?.sorry for bad english.
9821051	I have nothing against fragments, and Yes, they're the way to go, but for the beginner android developer, you can do achieve what you're trying to do with &lt;include&gt;s and base activities.This article explains nicely the use of &lt;include&gt;s, but to sum it up, you can have a layout xml file that you can "include" to another layout, instead of rewriting the same stuff over and over.For the functionality of the headers and footers (assuming they do something when clicked), you can create a base activity that you can extend instead of the normal android Activity.Define the logic for the header and footer clicks in this base activity, such as with this sample code:In your layout (the one you have as a separate xml), add an onClick attribute to your header/footer, assigning the name of the method in the base activity.such asThen it's just a matter of extending MyBaseActivity for all your activities that have headers and footers.
9823160	Check this out, you can indeed reuse your layout whenever you want it to.
9824172	Is it possible to find out whether a task with a certain task id exists? When I try to get the status, I will always get pending.Thanks a lot.EDIT:Let me explain this a little bit more. I want to know whether a given task id is a real celery task id and not a random string like blubb. I want different results depending on whether there is a valid task for a certain id. There may have been a valid task in the past with the same id but the results may have been deleted from the backend.
9824205	Trythat may work.It should return something different.
9830167	Figured out a solution:
9830455	Sorry if this is a rudimentary question, but what does the term 'Attribute' refer to in the context of PHPUnit testing? I know what properties and methods are, I know what public/private/protected do. I know the different between static and instance variables. But I see all these 'Attribute' oriented asserts in the PHPUnit command sets but none of the documentation I have seems to take the step back to describe what 'attribute' is actually referring to. properties? methods? all of the above???SW
9830495	More to read:
9830656	Properties.The assertAttribute metods are used to test public and private properties of a class or object.
9837786	I've got a timerand method:Now my question is how to call the method directly? I need to turn it on immediately not only after x time passed, so i wanted to call it. However this method returns crash([__NSCFDictionary userInfo]: unrecognized selector sent to instance):
9837837	you can do this,
9838005	As Vignesh suggested, you could just call the NSTimer with a time interval of 0. However, this could cause problems in the future.You would be better to have a function that does the processing,-(void)doProcessing:(NSDictionary *)theData {...And then have a timer methodSo you can then call it through the timer as you currently have, or you can call it directly with [self doProcessing:data]If you do it this way, then you will be much better placed if in the future you decide that after doing the processing you want to re-schedule the timer according to certain conditions but only if it was called through the timer as you can then do that in your timerAction method. You should try to get the functionality into as fine grained methods as possible, so don't mix the timer related bits with the processing bits.
9839176	Possible Duplicate: Android Launch an application from another application I am having a problem and it is the following one:I have two applications, and I want to launch one of the activities from one app by the other one......I am gonna give an example:first app package:  "es.wul4.android.app1"second app package:  "es.wul4.android.app2"What I want is to launch the activity whose class is called "Identificar" from the app1This activity is NOT the main one. I tried by doind that:But what i get doing that is nothing, it tells me that the app doesn´t exists.If i try doing that:And it launch one activity, but the main one........How can I launch this particular Activity inside the package "es.wul4.app2.Identificar"??Thank u very much.

9839299	I ran into same problem, but in my case the solution was not to keep the references to views, which caused problems with ListView's view caching. After properly implementing getView() method with use of converView, all strange behaviour with lost / unexpected click calls was gone.
9839568	What you need to use are intent-filters. Assume the activity to be launched is in the package launch.me. Inside this applications manifest all the activities (main or otherwise) will be decalred by the &lt;activity&gt; tag.Assuming the activity you want to launch is inside the class file Launchme. Then a portion of your manifest will be something like: Now in the activity from where you want to launch the above activity use:(Note: This activity can be in any package anywhere. You have to make sure that both, the calling and the called packages are available on the device)You can use other methods for starting the intent other than startActivityForResult, thats upto you.
9850317	Edit: Thanks to Sir @EugeneAbovsky for a simple explanation. The answer is not possible - I want to disable &lt;script&gt; tags. Here's my code, but it doesn't work.
9850334	What's the sense in disabling a script via JavaScript ? As far as I know there's no way available.
9850337	Can't be done... A script tag evaluates as soon as the DOM renderer renders it, so getting a handle on it after wards won't do much.

Currently, I have to set it manually. I do not want to disable IPV6 completely for the entire server other things may use that in the future. Is there an object I can reference in a PowerShell command specifying my NIC "Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Network Connection" and disable IPV6? Unfortunately, Group Policy is not an option says the boss. I've tried finding an appropriate WMI object via "PowerShell Scriptomatic" but failed to find the difference between an enabled setting versus disabled on the Intel NIC. Thanks in advance.

9869722	You cannot specify an app to be released on a specific date, regardless of whether it's a new app or a new version of an existing app. With new apps your app will be reviewed and approved by RIM but not posted for sale until you click the 'release for sale' button. For new versions of existing apps your updated app is placed for sale as soon as it's approved. You will receive email notification when this happens.As a rough guide here's how long it takes for apps to reviewed and published:New apps: 1-2 weeksNew versions of existing apps: 24-48 hours
9877301	Does KnockoutJS have a feature whereas I could take something like:Then select distinct on the "type" field, producing a result which looks like this:I'm aware of ko.utils.arrayGetDistinctValues, but that doesn't exactly do what I want. I'm also aware that I could write a few loops using ko.utils.arrayGetDistinctValues to get what I want, I'm just wondering if there is something else baked into KnockoutJS that I'm overlooking.
9877415	Would calling ko.utils.arrayFilter twice, once for 'Friend' and once for 'Enemy' solve your problem? Details here.
9877882	There is not anything else built into KO to make this any easier.There are many ways that you could make this work. For example, you could extend observableArrays to have a distinct function. Then, you can just create your observableArray like:The distinct function might look like:It supports chaining so you could call distinct multiple times with different properties.Sample here: This does rebuild the index once on each change, so if you have a huge list of items, then you would want to potentially explore other ways (manual subscriptions) for adding/removing items from the "index" arrays.
9879825	I can't seem to figure out how to add a reference programmatically to Excel 2007 using vba.I know how to do it manually Open VBE --> Tools --> References --> browse --_> File Location and Name. But that's not very useful for my purposes.I know there are ways to do it in Access Vb.net and code similar to this kept popping up, but I'm not sure I understand it, or if it's relevant. Edit: Thanks for your quick responses.They've helped quite a bit but so far no solution will be viable for my problem. (which is clearly my fault for not giving enough details). Here's exactly what I'm trying to do. I've written a program that runs and messages skype with information when if finishes. I need to add a reference for Skype4COM.dll in order to send a message through Skype. We have a dozen or so computers on a network and a shared file server (among other things). All of the other computers need to be able to run this program. I was hoping to avoid setting up the reference by hand. I had planned on putting the reference in a shared location, and adding it programmatically when the program ran. And that's where I got stumped and asked my original question.So far, in the solutions presented, in order to add the reference programmatically I will need to add a reference by hand and change the trust centre...which is more than just adding the reference.Though I guess if I follow through with the solutions proposed I will be able to add future references programmatically. Which probably makes it worth the effort.Any further thought would be great.

9880946	You're probably running this code on a background thread, and don't have an autorelease pool in place. ARC will still autorelease objects for you on occasion, and if you're calling into Apple frameworks, they may still be non-ARC, so they definitely could be autoreleasing objects for you. So you still need an autorelease pool in place.Cocoa creates an autorelease pool for you on the main thread, but doesn't do anything for you on background threads. If you're going to kick something off onto a background thread without using NSOperation or something, you'll want to wrap that thread in an @autoreleasepool, like so:

9886516	I don't believe it can be accomplished with the img-tag, as it will stretch the image according to your provided width/height. It would however be possible to use a div-element instead, and assign the image as a background. That way the image will not be re-sized, the parts of the image not possible of to display within your 100x100 px element will appear "cropped".By using the background-position attribute you could also control which parts of the image that gets "cropped".
9886521	Give height:auto when you change it's width. Write like this:

9897809	I am having a problem with a trigger. I created a trigger and a function to keep track of how many rows are in use by each user in my DB. The INSERT part of the trigger and function work correctly, but the DELETE does nothing. When I insert rows in my app, the rowcount goes up, when I delete, the rowcount does not change. Here is the TABLE where I keep the row count:Here is my TRIGGER:And here is the FUNCTION:Any ideas?Many thanks,Shea
9903697	Got table A, B and C. All tables have primary keys. Tables B and C both have field id_a which is a link to key of table A.I want to write a select statement which would select all rows from table A, one column from table C and one from B. But they must be joined like 2 independant columns. So that for one key from table A, there must be max(B,C) rows which contain all data from A plus those 2 colums, for expample:{bXY} means that it is a value from B, linked to value X from a, and Y is just enumerationOf course, for all values from tables B and C must correspond to table A by their id_a field. Table structures:
9904304	You can try the following for a start: (based on SQLServer rather than Oracle)To further improve, you can replace the variable @AValues by a SQL sub-query that will return all the rows from TableA as a comma seperated list.The union between TableB and TableC will give you all the primary key values of TableA that you are interested in, effectively max of rows in TableB and TableC. The left join will give you the values from either TableB or TableC. Hope this helps to some extent!
9904440	It is possible if you generate empty rows for table containing less rows. Each row from B and C is assigned a number. Full outer join adds missing rows.You can check it at Sql Fiddle
9919081	Returning NULL cancels the INSERT/DELETE operations. (You can use it for referential integrity too complicated to be enforced with a simple constraint.)You want to return OLD from the DELETE and NEW from the INSERT.

9927535	The error is clear. myLogFile is not defined anywhere in your output_messaging function. You need to define it in that function, or pass it in as a parameter.You shouldn't be using globals anyway, they are almost always a bad idea. Pass parameters explicitly.
9927578	In output_messaging, you don't have global myLogFile to indicate that myLogFile is defined somewhere else in the file. When Python runs that function, it doesn't recognize the variable now.Note that global variables are generally discouraged but that's a different discussion.

9927883	select * group by company won't work in Oracle.
9929809	After my original post, I went back to simplify the problem. I split the TRIGGER and FUNCTION into separate INSERT and DELETE activities. Both the INSERT TRIGGER and FUNCTION continue to work correctly as an AFTER trigger. So I have excluded it from the post. Here is a simplified problem with the DELETE trigger. Here is my new TRIGGER:And here is my new FUNCTION:This trigger is now working if I remove rows on the m_int table. The problem with the AFTER trigger was never resolved, but using a BEFORE with a RETURN OLD seems to be an ok substitute. By hard coding certain variables, the issue was related to the use of the OLD.result__id in the function.
9930249	The answer you need comes from three basic SQL concepts, I'll step through them with you. If you need more assistance to create an answer from these hints, let me know and I can try to keep guiding you.Group ByAs you mentioned, SQL offers a GROUP BY function that can help you.A SQL Query utilizing GROUP BY would look like the following.a GROUP BY query can only return fields listed in the group by statement, or aggregate functions acting on each group.Aggregate FunctionsYour homework question also needs an Aggregate function called Count. This is used to count the results returned. A simple query like the following returns the count of all records returned.The two can be combined, allowing you to get the Count of each group in the following way.Column AliasesAnother answer also tried to introduce you to SQL column aliases, but they did not use SQLPLUS syntax.SQLPLUS column alias syntax is shown below.
9930842	There is now SQL Fiddle, which has as one of the engines you can use SQL Server. You can read the details in the about page, and see the code on Github. The author Jake Feasel, a current StackOverflow user who liked JSFiddle and wanted something similar for SQL.

9938830	First of all: this is pointless.You are creating an object wrapper for the 10+ year old mysql_* function. This php extension is no longer maintained and the process of deprecation has already begun. You should not use this API for any new projects in 2012.Instead you should learn how to use PDO or MySQLi and work with prepared statements.That said .. lets take a look at your code:Constructor should receive all the parameters required for creating new instance, parameters should not be hard-coded in the class definition. What if you need to work with two databases at the same time ?When connection is created, it should be stored in object's scope variable. Something along the lines of $this-&gt;connection = mysql_conn.... Instead you store it in local variable, which you "loose" right after constructor is done.You should not use private variables for everything. They are not visible to classes which would extend your original class. Unless it is intentional, you should choose protected for this.The or die('..') bit most go. Do not stop the whole application if connection fails. Instead you should throw an exception, which then can be handled outside of the constructor.

9939888	I am facing a dilemma regarding OOP design of my application. Should I make the auth class a singleton or not. I see that kohana framework and zend framework use their auth classes as a singleton. What are the disadvantages of making the authentification class a singleton? What are the pros? Also the application I am building will be an enterprise application and it needs to scale, so will my auth system also scale if it will be a singleton?
9939954	In PHP, the object doesn't stays in the memory once the request is completed. So even if you make your object as Singleton, every request will have its own instance of that class.But the the difference will come when object is being accessed multiple times in a single request. In that case, singleton has following advantages:Prevents creating multiple redundant instances, so lesser memory usage for requests.Shares the same data across multiple accesses.Eg: Codeigniter's get_instance function is an implementation of Singleton Concept, whereby only one Codeigniter instance is used in each request.
9940064	Here would be some cons:extremely hard to test, because code is tied to name of classintroduction of global stateinability to determine causes for an effect - unrelated methods can affect each otherscattering of authentication requests all over codebaseviolation of LoDYou might benefit a lot from examining, at what stage and how exactly you authenticate the user ( do not confuse with authorization ). Also, this topic might be of some interest to you.Update:Here are few videos you might be interested in:Clean Code Talks: Unit TestingClean Code Talks: Global State and SingletonsClean Code Talks: Don't Look For Things!PHP UK Conference 2011: Advanced OO Patterns

9946238	Please, stop using ORDER BY RAND(). Just stop. This operation has complexity of n*log2(n), which means that the time spent on query would grow "If you want to generate random results, create a stored procedure, which generates them. Something like this (code taken from this article, which you should read): And to use it, you would write: As for executing it all on PHP side, you should stop using the ancient mysql_* API. It is more than 10 years old and no longer maintained. Community has even begun process for deprecating them. There should not be any more new code written with mysql_* in 2012. Instead you should use PDO or MySQLi. As for how to write it (with PDO):UpdateIf the requirement is to get not only 10 random results, but actually 10 UNIQUE random results, then it would require two changes to the PROCEDURE:The temporary table should enforce the uniqueness of entries:It also might make sense to collect just IDs and not the values. Esspecially if what you are looking for are 10 unique articles, not just tags.When inserting a duplicate value is found, the cnt counter should not decrease. This can be ensured by adding a HANDLER (before definition of LOOP), which would "catch" the raised warning, and adjust the counter:
9949084	Use SQL Server CE.You can create a database file like this:Create a SQL Server Compact Edition Database with C#I'd use this because is "official" MS database. So it will work fine with MS technologies (Linq to SQL, Entity framework, etc.) It's also a very lightweight DB. Take into acount that there's also available SQL Server Express, but that's not such a lightweight database.Code to create database:Distributing it only requires copying a few small assemblies (for example the installer for SQL Server CE 2005 it's a 1.7Mb .msi file which results in 7 assemblies) Zero configuration. And there are versions which can be used with .NET framework 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 (version SQL Server 2005 up to SQL CE 4.0).If someone can't see the adavantage of being supported by MS, so that using it with C# and otherMS technologies, and having a good documentation on MSDN.I suppose that I got downvotes because someone is allergic to MS.

9951908	I have a .txt file that contains a list of IP address:There's a lot more than that though :)Anyway, imported this into a list using Python and I'm trying to get it to sort them, but I'm having trouble. Anybody have any ideas?EDIT:Ok since that was vague, this is what I had so fair.
9951961	You're probably sorting them by ascii string-comparison ('.' &lt; '5', etc.), when you'd rather that they sort numerically. Try converting them to tuples of ints, then sorting:edit: The ValueError you are getting is because your text files are not entirely in the #.#.#.#:# format as you imply. (There may be comments or blank lines, though in this case the error would hint that there is a line with more than one ':'.) You can use debugging techniques to home in on your issue, by catching the exception and emitting useful debugging data:I was a bit sloppy in the above, in that it still lets some invalid IP addresses through (e.g. #.#.#.#.#, or 257.-1.#.#). Below is a more thorough solution, which allows you do things like compare IP addresses with the &lt; operators, also making sorting work naturally:and then:Demo:Changing the values to be for example 264... or ...-35... will result in the appropriate errors.
9952018	You can pre-proces the list so it can be sorted using the built in comparison function. and then process it back to a more normal format.strings will be the same length and can be sorted . Afterwards, we simply remove all spaces.you can google around and find other examples of this.if you have a ton of ip address you are going to get better processing time if you use c++. it will be more work up front but you will get better processing times.
9952137	I have a SQL Server database with 500,000 records in table main. There are also three other tables called child1, child2, and child3. The many to many relationships between child1, child2, child3, and main are implemented via the three relationship tables: main_child1_relationship, main_child2_relationship, and main_child3_relationship. I need to read the records in main, update main, and also insert into the relationship tables new rows as well as insert new records in the child tables. The records in the child tables have uniqueness constraints, so the pseudo-code for the actual calculation (CalculateDetails) would be something like:This works fine as a single threaded app. But it is too slow. The processing in C# is pretty heavy duty and takes too long. I want to turn this into a multi-threaded app.What is the best way to do this? We are using Linq to Sql.So far my approach has been to create a new DataContext object for each batch of records from main and use ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem to process it. However these batches are stepping on each other's toes because one thread adds a record and then the next thread tries to add the same one and ... I am getting all kinds of interesting SQL Server dead locks.Here is the code:And here is ProcessBatch:And CalculateDetails is best explained by the pseudo-code at the top. I think there must be a better way to do this. Please help. Many thanks!
9962177	I'm working on a program that returns the largest number that is in both arrays. The following is some expectations: My code works for many situations, but not for this one: Instead of yielding "-10", my program returns a "-11". The following is my UPDATED code: I thought the logic of the code should be fine, but it still does not work. Some other cases for which the logic fails are: My code yields "0" instead. My code yields "6" instead.The purpose of the ArrayLists is to somehow remove an element after each comparison. I have not used that feature here.
9962241	Now its working fine.
9962318	the following works:
9963080	Consider the code:Now, consider this:I heard an array is equivalent to a constant pointer and can't be incremented as it is not a lvalue...Then why does first code gets compiled, is it so because array arguments to functions are passed as a pointer, i.e. T[] is converted to T* for passing..So, foo(a) passes a as a pointer.But is it not back converted to T[] again because is declared as:
9963088	When you pass an array as an argument to a function, it decays to a pointer.So the thing you increment inside the function body is a pointer, not an array.
9963313	Inside the function, a is an address itself, which points to a local variable. You can increment it because it's an address. Also you can do something like this:No errors.
9966492	I am developing a program in which I need to stop a loop when a flag is true. This is a short example of that I want:When the condition should end the loop. But this is not true. What is the problem?EDIT:The code is as follows:I print a message to check if the execution enter in the IF and it enter.
9966511	Instead of using the condition on the for, use only a break statement.
9966514	Let me guess ... i was not defined ?
9968866	I need to create lines like this:I really stumble with it, for example i can create &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt; but when i try to add text to it then my span is gone.It's probably quite easy but i can't get it done.O yeah a lot of things can be done with a one-line solution. I don't care much about it being it compact, i prefer a clear solution (although one-line solutions can be clear). here the jsfiddle:
9968898	Ok, here we go:In your for loop I did like this:Hope I got it right!
9969098	So a simple solution here would be to break it up into parts.Each time you make a statement it can return the newly created item.Lets look at your example - We'll take a base object to start with - let us say for example the &lt;ul&gt; element that you are wanting to append to - This assumes a &lt;ul&gt; element like &lt;ul id="someList"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; to be in the HTML markup.And append to it another new &lt;li&gt; element returning it to a new objectGreat! we got this far - now we add the &lt;span&gt;'sI've gone about this in a very spread out way - there is no need to perform each operation in a different command. jQuery has a fantastic feature called chaining. What chaining means (as the name imply's) is that you can chain functions together. I already gave an example in the code aboveAs you can see I am appending the &lt;span&gt; element and immediately after calling the text() function. This is possible because most if not all built-in jQuery functions (an indeed any well built plugins) will return the object itself when it exits. For example - Would allow us to do this -because each function (* hiccup *) would return another cold beer! Cheers!

9982864	I need to get name of my android application from the native side somethin like that:my native code like that:and i just pass the activity to my native methon from java code.and i don't have a chance to write this code in java class then call it form my NDK application I'm trying a lot to pass a context object as jobject to my native code but it always crash.dose any one have any idea?
9983027	Why do you need to do so from the NDK? Perhaps it would be more useful for us to help you debug the problem passing a context object, and then you could just pass the app name as a string.
9983429	Reflected Java access in C is ugly, ugly, ugly, just like you've demonstrated. Pass the app name as an extra string parameter.EDIT: OK, you want reflection, reflection you'll get.Your native method belongs to class AnalyticToolActivity. As a nonstatic class method, it has a this pointer on every call. Unlike C++ and Java methods, this pointer is passed explicitly as the second parameter. The method has two mandatory parameters - a JNIEnv * and a jobject. The second one corresponds to the this pointer of the Java object.So if your AnalyticToolActivity is a subclass of Activity - quite likely - the entryObject parameter is an instance of Activity, meaning it's an instance of Context. So get rid of the third parameter (contxt), and your JNI code can go like this:and so forth.

10035988	Here's my take on the problem:When using multiple threads to insert/update/query data in SQL Server, or any database, then deadlocks are a fact of life. You have to assume they will occur and handle them appropriately.That's not so say we shouldn't attempt to limit the occurence of deadlocks. However, it's easy to read up on the basic causes of deadlocks and take steps to prevent them, but SQL Server will always surprise you :-)Some reason for deadlocks:Too many threads - try to limit the number of threads to a minimum, but of course we want more threads for maximum performance.Not enough indexes. If selects and updates aren't selective enough SQL will take out larger range locks than is healthy. Try to specify appropriate indexes.Too many indexes. Updating indexes causes deadlocks, so try to reduce indexes to the minimum required.Transaction isolational level too high. The default isolation level when using .NET is 'Serializable', whereas the default using SQL Server is 'Read Committed'. Reducing the isolation level can help a lot (if appropriate of course).This is how I might tackle your problem:I wouldn't roll my own threading solution, I would use the TaskParallel library. My main method would look something like this:Execute the CalculateDetails method with retries for deadlock failuresThe core CalculateDetails methodAnd of course my implementation of a deadlock retry helperOne further possibility is to use a partitioning strategyIf your tables can naturally be partitioned into several distinct sets of data, then you can either use SQL Server partitioned tables and indexes, or you could manually split your existing tables into several sets of tables. I would recommend using SQL Server's partitioning, since the second option would be messy. Also built-in partitioning is only available on SQL Enterprise Edition.If partitioning is possible for you, you could choose a partion scheme that broke you data in lets say 8 distinct sets. Now you could use your original single threaded code, but have 8 threads each targetting a separate partition. Now there won't be any (or at least a minimum number of) deadlocks.I hope that makes sense.

10041612	SELECT userid, username, email, phonenumber FROM Email LEFT JOIN Phonenumber USING (userid) LEFT JOIN User USING (userid)
10043428	Let's start with a version of your data that's not normalized at all, and add some additional, reasonable data so we can see how normalization works here. (Assumes everyone has at least one email address and one phone number, simply to avoid talking about nulls.)If you look closely at that data, you'll find that the only key is {email, phonenumber}. That's why you're having trouble getting only three rows--that key is nowhere in your tables. This is what @ontrack was getting at by saying, "Your tables do not have a unique relation between emails and phone-numbers." Following the algorithm for determining candidate keys in any database textbook will give you the same thing. AFAIK, every textbook on database theory has at least one algorithm for determining candidate keys.Obviously, if you had a table that had {email, phonenumber} as the key, you'd get only 3 rows for userid 1.

10059596	I know what AJAX stands for. I know javascript passably well. But frankly I'm just not clear on what AJAX is.Because all I know about it is XMLHttpRequest(), but it must be so much more than that. Can someone give a clearer explanation of how AJAX isn't just a certain aspect of perfectly ordinary JavaScript? I can't see how it's anything different.EDIT: I also understand that it allows you to update a page without reloading. That's fantastic, I know. But I still don't see how that's anything more than standard JavaScript.
10059603	It's a way of getting and sending data from and to the server asynchronously without refreshing the page. Data exchanged used to be just XML (the "X" in AJAX), can now be other things (e.g. JSON or even JSONP).
10059634	Well it's not as if it's magic or something. It really is ordinary Javascript, and it's ordinary XML (or JSON, or some other data format). And it runs in a browser. None of this is particularly new or novel. Microsoft was talking about "DHTML" in 1996, and officially released it in 1997. But combining these existing things, is an approach that is common enough and useful enough to have earned a specific name. AJAX refers tothe pattern of using asynchronous requests, driven in Javascript logic running in the browser, to retrieve data in XML format or otherwise. Typically the retrieved data is then used to update the HTML page in some way, without causing a full page refresh. You said you don't see how that's anything more than standard JavaScript.Using Javascript in a browser you could do something as simple as run a timer that pops up an alert after it expires. Or you could perform a fadeout on a background color. Or do jQuery effects like accordion popouts. Or dynamically sort an HTML table by different columns. Even autocomplete in textboxes is possible using Javascript. These all cause the UI to be updated, but they don't necessarily retrieve any data. (in some cases autocomplete will do so, but not generally). AJAX always involves communication and data retrieval, so it is distinct from "standard Javascript".

10068113	I would guess that you are trying to access a protected variable outside of the scope of the Files class definition. I would recommend a function that returns the variable word when it is called and use that instead of trying to access a protected variable outside of a class definition. I could be wrong in that I am not really sure what is the scope of a protected variable (whether it is limited only to class declarations or whether it can be accessed outside of the class definition) but I am pretty sure that I am right because protected variables are like private variables. They are only accessible within the class scope. Correct me if I am wrong. EDIT: Oh I am sorry I didn't realize what you were doing. littleadv is right, your function declaration isn't within the files namespace.

10108999	You problem is that both columns don't have the same type - they don't match exactly:  If you re-create a table that was dropped, it must have a definition that conforms to the foreign key constraints referencing it.

If these are not satisfied, MySQL returns error number 1005 and refers to error 150 in the error message.

If you've done that as well, you're done. run_gunicorn will be available.So, if it's not working, one of the following is in play:Gunicorn isn't actually installed. However, you should get an error trying to reference in in INSTALLED_APPS in that scenario. Check your virtualenv's site-packages directory to ensure there's gunicorn folder there.You installed Gunicorn in a different virtualenv. Again, you should be getting an error just as in #1. And, just as in #1, check to make sure it's actually in the proper virtualenv's site-packages directoryYou don't have the virtualenv activated. However, same error as in #1 and #2 applies here.You really don't have gunicorn in INSTALLED_APPS or a compiled version of settings.py is being used that doesn't have it in INSTALLED_APPS.

Also, some applications might mess up when they recreate the file when saving.Distributed Link Tracking ServiceDistributed Link Tracking Service uses file object ID's for, well, tracking links to files, and repairing them when the file is moved. AFAIK Distributed Link Tracking Service requires a domain controller for the server. Again, I have no practical experience with this.On NTFS, you could also create and store a UUID in an alternate data stream. Caveats:Only available on NTFS, will not "survive" on other file systemsOne white paper "the future of NTFS" considered killing them, but I fancy the thought there were some other features that could help you (unfortunately, I failed to dig that out)I wouldn't want to create that for thousands of files of unknown origin and purpose. Though they "just work" on the file system level, some applications might mess up.Some document formats - such as Office - allow custom document properties.That's obviously limited, but similar mechanisms can be piggybacked onto other file types as well. (e.g. many image formats would allow adding / rewriting "custom" chunks that should be ignored by readers)FileFromID vs. IDFromFileAlll solutions except DLTS only allow IDFromFile lookup, i.e. locating a file that has moved (or was deleted) requires searching all potential drives.For DLTS, if there's no "direct API" way, you could store a DLTS-enabled shortcut in an application-specific folder, and ~~hope for~~ expect the service to repair the shortcut when the file is moved.
10130940	Alright, with some help from the CM team I got the right answer to this.Use the CheckInEvent instead of save. Even if the item is in workflow it will still invoke this event when you click Save &amp; Close (and only if you click Save &amp; Close, not when you click Save).Something like this will get me going:[TcmExtension("Publish to Wip Events")]public class PublishToWip : TcmExtension{ public PublishToWip() { EventSystem.Subscribe&lt;VersionedItem, CheckInEventArgs&gt; (PublishItemToWip, EventPhases.Processed); } private void PublishItemToWip(VersionedItem item,  CheckInEventArgs args, EventPhases phases) { if (!item.LockType.HasFlag(LockType.InWorkflow)) return; if (!item.IsCheckedOut) return; // do something now

10148328	I'm using the "include" function (e.x. "include 'header2.php'" or "include 'class.users.php'")to add the header or session class in my website. I don't really remember where, but I heard that hackers abuse, somehow, this "include" thing, sending the fake included page or something like that.So basically I would like to know what's with that "include" function, how can I protect it, how do they abuse it and if there are better solutions for what I am looking for.Thanks in advance.
10148384	The best thing to do is ensure that the page you are trying to include exists first. The real security loopholes come when your include page is processed from some sort of user input, such as a URL variable. ?include=page.php As long as you are cautious of these you should be fine.

10148849	Hey I had this question in an interview and was wondering what was the best way to solve it. So say you are given an array that is already sorted and you want to find the lowest index of some value x.Here is a python/pseudocode of what I came up with, I am just wondering if there is a better way to go about it?Thanks!
10148975	I'd bet good money that g.d.d.c's comment is the fastest answer for python. Otherwise, your general algorithm is correct, except for the fact that in some cases you can beat the O(log n) behavior of binary search. Specifically, in the case of integers the best worst-case behavior you can get is O(sqrt(log n)):
10148989	Your method takes linear time in the worst case, which is when the count of xs in the array is O(n).An O(lg n) solution can be obtained by changing the binary search itself to find the first x in the array instead of just any one of them:

10186344	From here, it says that select() is used to "monitor multiple file descriptors, waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become "ready" for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input possible)". Then I looked at the Beej's guide for socket programming, they used select() to monitor socket file descriptor. In short, the tutorials and man pages said that select() operates on file descriptor. However, I came across a piece of code that usesselect() to monitor an object. Code:So the question is, how does select() determine if my "object is ready"?

10186514	FD_SET and friends take an integer as the first argument...So the only way your code can compile is if either (a) SomeObject has a user-defined SomeObject::operator int() conversion operator that returns the file descriptor:or (b) the FD_* operations are defined as real functions (and not macros) and there are user-defined overloads of FD_* that take SomeObject and extract/map them to an fd and then call the original system version:
10186554	select() and FD_SET work on file descriptors, which are actually integers, not pointers to "SomeObject".

I want to set the JButton to the exact size of the image, not slightly larger than it, and I also want to move the JButton down to the bottom of the screen.

Is there any other function available for getting the Bounding rectangle of an element ?
10231057	You could use offsets to do that, like this:
10231202	Citation from old IE documentation for getBoundingClientRect: "In Microsoft® Internet Explorer 5, the window's upper-left is at 2,2 (pixels) with respect to the true client." This still seems to be valid.In IE9 usage of &lt;meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge"/&gt; "sets" the upper-left corner to it's right position (0,0).As d4rkpr1nc3 answered, you can get those values by other methods, but the results depend on the used browser too. I think you'll need a slightly different approach to this problem. Check the code below, it might give you some ideas.And please improve your accept rate, there are many acceptable answers for your questions.
10232714	Can I use string.Format like this?1 ) Replace Number to String**2 ) Is it possible add strings one by one to string template
10232759	NoYes; just build an array, then pass that array to String.Format (this is the particular overload you would be using):
10232812	Yes it is possible. But you will want to create a String array, and assign the spots in the String array to the names you want. Then simply call the array position you want to call.So for example:

10261796	The array is basically a JSON object, you need to parse it using JSON parser.

I recommend using $.ajax() and specifying the dataType as JSON, or using $.getJSON().Here is an example that demonstrates $.ajax() and shows you how to access the returned values in an array.Now, if you insist on using $.each, the following will work for the success option.Feel free to ask any questions!

10267046	I'm designing a database that will need to be optimized for maximum speed.All the database data is generated once from something I call an input database (which holds the data I'm editing, mainly some polylines, markers, etc for google maps).So the database is not subject to editing, but it needs to hold as many data as it can for quickly displaying results to the user (routes across town, custom polylines, etc).The question is: choosing smaller data types for example like smallint over int will improve performance or it will affect it? Space is not quite a problem, after some quick calculations, the database will not exceed 200mb, and there will not be tables with more than 100.000 rows (average will be around 5.000).I'm asking this because I read some articles around the internet and some say that smaller data types improve performance others say that it affects it because additional processing must be done. I'm aware that for smaller databases probably results are not noticeable, but I'm interested in every bit because I'm expecting many requests which will trigger a lot more queries.The hosting environment is gonna be Windows Server 2008 R2 with SQL Server 2008 R2.EDIT 1: Just to give you an example because I don't have a proper table structure yet:I'm going to have a table which will hold public transportation lines (somewhere around 200), identified by a unique number in real life, and which is going to be referenced in all sorts of tables and on which all sorts of operations are going to be made. These referencing tables will hold the largest amount of data.Because lines have unique numbers, I have thought of 3 examples of designs:The PK is the line number of datatype: smallintThe PK is the line number of datatype: intThe PK is something different (identity for example) and the line number is stored in a different field.Just for the sake of argument, because I used this on the 'input database' which is not subject to optimization, the PK is a GUID (16 bytes); if you like, you can make a comparison of how bad is this compared to others, if it really isSo keep in mind that the PK is going to be referenced in at least 15 tables, some of which will have over 50.000 rows (the rest averaging 5.000 as I said above) which are going to be subject to constant querying and manipulation, and I'm interested in every bit of speed that I can get.I can detail this even more if you need. ThanksEDIT 2: And another question related to this came to my mind, think it fits into this discussion: Will I see any performance improvements in this specific scenario if I use native SQL queries from inside my .NET application rather than using LINQ to SQL? I know LINQ is strongly optimized and generates very good queries performance-wise, but still, sure worth asking. Thanks again.
10267258	I've never seen any application work like this, maybe you cannot implement it normally.But I guess you just want to see the letters from Draw something. How about take a screenshot first and set the screenshot image as the background of your app so you can see the letters from your app?
10267291	I've just found out found android.animation.ObjectAnimator was only introduced in Android API 11. Is there any other way of animating objects on older android phones?
10267345	ObjectAnimator is indeed introduced in Android 3.0(API Level 11), it cannot be found on 2.3.6.
10267371	there are plenty of apps that show a floating view on top of everything like : airbrowser , LilyPad , Stick it , AirTerm , Smart Taskbar , aircalc ...anyway , in order to achieve this feature , you must have a special permission called "android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" , and use something like that:
10267380	You can use Jake Wharton's NineOldAndroids [1] which is a backport of the Honeycomb new Animation Framework for 2.x Android devices. It is very easy to use, as it mimics the same API you would use on 11+ devices.[1]
10268495	Can you point to some articles that say that smaller data types = more processing? Keeping in mind that even with SSDs most workloads today are I/O-bound (or memory-bound) and not CPU-bound.Particularly in cases where the PK is going to be referenced in many tables, it will be beneficial to use the smallest data type possible. In this case if that's a SMALLINT then that's what I would use (though you say there are about 200 values, so theoretically you could use TINYINT which is half the size and supports 0-255). Where you need to exercise caution is if you aren't 100% sure that there will always be ~200 values. Once you need 256 you're going to have to change the data type in all of the affected tables, and this is going to be a pain. So sometimes a trade-off is made between accommodating future growth and squeezing the absolute most performance today. If you don't know for certain that you will never exceed 255 or 32,000 values then I would probably just an INT. Unless you also don't know that you won't ever exceed 2 billion values, in which case you would use BIGINT.The difference between INT/SMALLINT/TINYINT is going to be more noticeable in disk space than in performance. (And if you're on Enterprise, the differences in both disk space and performance can be offset quite a bit using data compression - particularly while your INT values all fit within SMALLINT/TINYINT, though in the latter case it really will be negligible because the values are unique.) On the other hand, the difference between any of these and GUID is going to be much more noticeable in both performance and disk space. Marc gave some great links from Kimberly; I wrote this article in 2003 and while it's a little dated it does contain most of the salient points that are still relevant today.Another trade-off that sometimes needs to be considered (though not in your specific case, it seems) is whether values need to be unique across multiple systems. This is where you might need to sacrifice some performance in order to meet business requirements. In a lot of cases folks take the easy way and resign themselves to GUID. But there are other solutions too, such as identity ranges, a central custom sequence generator, and the new SEQUENCE object in SQL Server 2012. I wrote about SEQUENCE back in 2010 when the first public beta of SQL Server 2012 was released.

(When you log in, some view items are removed or added based on who you are; when you log out, I want to reset them to their default values, which I've specified in the storyboard.)I realize that I could programmatically reset/re-add all of the elements, but then what good is the storyboard? I figure there's got to be a way to get back to square one by reloading the view file, right?
10275908	I've to objects in my code that I always want to access when I need them.A database object, which holds the connection to the database. This is a static object, the connection won't change.And I've a user object, which holds the user level, username and id.I read some posts and articles about the way how to to this. I found 3 solutions- using a singleton- serialize object and store it in session- use dependency injection.Singleton is bad because globals are bad.Serialize an object and store it in a session seems ugly to me (don't exactly know why)Using Dependency injection makes your constructor crowded with parameters.Now I've two questions- Is there another way that I didn't mention?- What is the best method to grant overall access to objects mentioned above?
10275988	You are messing up everything. What is the best method to grant overall access to objects mentioned above?No, there is no such method at allThey are different objects and require different treatment. for the database object you have but little choice.You can create it with every request and use it throughout processing (of course you will need to make it global to use inside other classes).Or use it as a static singleton object, which will be called each time you need to interact with database. It will establish a database connection at the first call and eventually use it until the end of the processing request. With another request it will start over.For the user object both transparent serializing in a session and dependency injection are good.However, creating a user object on each request is not that bad idea. In your place I won't torture sessions such a way.

10286219	You can either add an optional parameter to your Edit action that flags whether or not you came from the Add action or you could create an entirely new action (with a unique name from Edit).The former would look something like:And the latter, obviously, would be:

10291232	What you want to create is often called a slug. I am not aware of anything built into the Zend framework for generating slugs, so you'll need to generate one on your own. Here's a really simple method to generate a slug.To make this more robust, you should check to see if the slug you generate already exists in the database. If it does, you could automatically add a number to the end. For example, if "this-blog-post" already exists, try "this-blog-post-1".In addition to generating a slug, you'll want to follow the zerkms's comment and add a route in your Zend configuration that will pass this slug to your controller.
10291646	First you will create a controller let say dateAction which accepts date as input parameters and list articles based on those days. Lets say you created dateAction inside article controller.so make this url do the job www.example.com/article/date/year/2012/month/06/day/24/title/abcdef first but now you want to change it into something beautiful so use Zend_RouterAfter doing that you will like to create a route in your bootstrapNow url http://www.example.com/2012/6/24/blog-title will work same as www.example.com/article/date/year/2012/month/06/day/24/title/abcdef
10295374	I have a form with a text area, I need to remove from the string entered here eventuals multiple spaces and multiple new lines.I have written this function to remove the multiple spacesThis function works good for spaces, but it also replace the new lines changing them into a single space.I need to change multiple spaces into 1 space and multiple new lines into 1 new line.How can I do?
10295416	UseThis will work specifically for spaces and newlines; you will have to add other whitespace characters (such as \t for tabs) to the regex if you want to target them as well.This regex works by matching either one or more spaces or one or more newlines and replacing the match with a space (but only if spaces were matched) and a newline (but only if newlines were matched).Update: Turns out there's some regex functionality tailored for such cases which I didn't know about (many thanks to craniumonempty for the comment!). You can write the regex perhaps more appropriately as
10295448	You know that \s in regex is for all whitepsaces, this means spaces, newlines, tab etc.If You would like to replace multiple spaces by one and multiple newlines by one, You would have to rwrite the function to call preg_replace twice - once replacing spaces and once replacing newlines...
10306931	For some reason my post value of the bookingDate is not getting put into the database and I"m not sure why.Inside the console here's the post variables. bookingDate 04/25/2012 14:36 inside the database  bookingDate datetime
10306989	Is $bookingDate initialized when you pass it into the function?You'll need to manually assign the $_POST['bookingDate'] to the variable $bookingDate with a line like this prior to calling your bookEvent() function.$bookingDate = $_POST['bookingDate'];In any case you should echo $bookingDate; prior to calling your function so that we can verify that $bookingDate is holding the value you expect it to be for your database insert.

10309198	What is the meanign of javascript:; that is kept inside the href attribute in an link? Like
10309302	You can imagine that as someone copying that "javascript:;" into the url box and hitting Enter. Since it starts with "javascript:" the browser will know to execute what follows as javascript in the current page. Since all that follows is a ";", nothing will happen, actually. That's the same as clicking a button that has a onClick attribute set to ";".For example:has the same effect thator evenKeep in mind that, since it's a link, most browsers will render its address (in that case "javascript:alert('howdy!')") in the status bar, and that may be undesired (I find it to be particularly ugly).
10309307	IF you need to pass a javascript snippet which needs to run instead of the default behavior of an element then you use this javascript: ; syntax.For exampleSimilarly, you can combine these on other events also, like onclick, onchange etc but this is really not necessary, since you can execute the snippet, directly.The uses of this, i have seen in years are:&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;form action="javascript:void(0);"&gt;..&lt;/form&gt;

10337066	I have a class called Calculator, which is extended by many other classes. It has a method called intern() which reads as follows: If I have, say, a BetaCalculator called bc, I'd like to be able to intern it by saying Currently though I have to say Is there any way to make it so that the intern() method would always have a return type of the type on which it was called? And if there isn't a way to do this, is there a reason why it's not possible? Possible solutions I'm aware of though am unsatisfied with:Rewriting the intern() method in every calculator I writePassing the intern() method a Class and having it return a T (e.g.&lt;T extends DailyValueCalculator> T intern(Class&lt;T> returnType){...}Giving DailyValueCalculator a Type &lt;T> (i.e. making it DailyValueCalculator&lt;T>) that all subclasses would be required to specify where T is equal to the type of the subclass and then having intern() return a T.
10337156	No there's no way to do this. Think about it: I know you know that the intern method is just going to return back the same class, but how could the compiler?
10337183	You can do it if you type your super-class with itself. Here is an example:

10341109	I want to use a function in all models class (in project folder and in plugins folder).Where should I declare it?
10341264	This solution works with Symfony 1.4:You create a new file in which you declare the function you want to be available everywhere.You load that file with the auto prepend file settingin the php.ini file.If done correctly, that function is available in all your scripts, regardless of model, plugin or something else from your project.
10341678	Depending on what your function does, you can create a file in the lib folder and then call it from every where in your app. This is useful in a Symfony project to define common functions (like a toolbox).For example, in the Jobeet tutorial, they define a method called slugify in /lib/Jobeet.class.php (be sure to name the file with .class.php at the end so Symfony will automatically load it). Then, you can call Jobeet::slugify() every where in your app/model/plugin/view.
10342486	I came across this one liner that appears to work:Can anyone explain why, because I thought stop-service didn't work unless you either used remoting or it occurred on the local host.
10343021	The output of Get-Service is a System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController .NET class that can operate on remote computers. How it accomplishes that, I don't know - probably DCOM or WMI. Once you've gotten one of these from Get-Service, it can be passed into Stop-Service which most likely just calls the Stop() method on this object. That stops the service on the remote machine. In fact, you could probably do this as well:
10349693	As far as I know, and I cant verify it now, you cannot stop remote services with the Stop-Service cmdlet or with .Net, it is not supported.Yes it works, but it stopes the service on your local machine, not on the remote computer.Now, if the above is correct, without remoting or wmi enabled, you could set a scheduled job on the remote system, using AT, that runs Stop-Service locally.
10351772	How do I convert a space separated integer input into a list of integers?Example input:Example conversion:
10351826	map() is your friend, it applies the function given as first argument to all items in the list.since it maps every iterable, you can even do:which (in python3.x) returns a map object, which can be converted to a list.I assume you are on python3, since you used input, not raw_input.

10354875	Probably the device you are using cannot support 4MB images when decompressed in a UIWebView.Which device are you using?4 minutes to load 4 images is a very long time. Is your network very bad? Otherwise it could be another indicator of wrong approach.Being you I'll try to use native UIImageView to display the images and perform some kind of queued download, maybe with ASIHTTP.So you can load and unload the images when you need them and avid keeping them always in memory.As Jojas point, I still think that the answer is correct as the UIWevView drains memory to render the DOM elements.
10355626	I've been writing a program that uses a stop and wait protocol on top of UDP to send packets over LAN and also over WAN. I've recently been testing my program and have noticed that the packet loss rate is higher for larger packets (approaching 64k bytes). Intuitively this makes sense but what are the actual reasons for this?
10356170	UDP packets greater than the MTU size of the network that carries them will be automatically split up into multiple packets, and then reassembled by the recipient. If any of those multiple sub-packets gets dropped, then the receiver will drop the rest of them as well. So for example if you send a 63k UDP packet, and it goes over Ethernet, it will get broken up into 47+ smaller "fragment" packets (because Ethernet's MTU is 1500 bytes, but some of those are used for UDP headers, etc, so the amount of user-data-space available in a UDP packet is smaller than that). The receiver will only "see" that UDP packet if all 47+ of those fragment-packets make it through okay. If just one of those fragment-packets gets dropped, the whole operation fails.
10358364	So I get the whole Android pixel independency thing.I'm creating a SplashScreen that is using a 9patch that will stretch its edges to account for all screensizes.I also use a differenlty sized 9patch image in ldpi mpdi hdpi xhdpi for each splash screen as well. That way the logo (the non stretched area of the 9patch) will be the correct size.I know mdpi is 1.0 and hdpi x1.5 in relative size and xhdpi is x2, but when I'm creating that first mdpi image how do I know how many pixels wide/high it should be? Hope that makes sense.

10359592	I received an OOM exception at one point in Cassandra. Mine is a single instance running on a modestly powered server, and i was doing some load testing, so no surprise there.But, i have subsequently been unable to use the instance. When i list the keyspaces, only "system" is shown. But when i try to recreate the keyspace i was testing with, Hector responds with the dreaded "All host pools marked down. Retry burden pushed out to client." message, and the Cassandra log has the following stack trace:The old keyspace was still in the data dir, so i moved it, but that didn't help. It seems that the system data still has an invalid reference somewhere. Does anyone know how to fix this?Edit: from the CLI, a "describe cluster;" only describes the "system" keyspace. But when i "use system;" and then "list schema_keyspaces;" the following is displayed:"mango" is the keyspace that i can no longer access, but it is still in there to some degree. Is there any way to fix it?
10360291	(...) when I'm creating that first mdpi image how do I know how many pixels wide/high it should be?Since mdpi is the baseline for all other density buckets, 1dp on an mdpi device will translate to exactly 1px. In other words, use an mdpi device to figure out the relative size on the screen and from there on apply the given scaling ratios to produce resources for the ldpi, hdpi and xhdpi buckets. Obviously you do not actually have to scale up that mdpi resource - all you need determine is the size for that screen density and then you can use whatever source file to produce images for all buckets.The link xBroak has given, is actually the best source of information regarding your question. A quote from there to support above statements: The density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a "medium" density screen. It may also come in handy to be aware of the simple d(i)p to px formula (also from that same link): The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi / 160)With this information, you can easily verify that 1dp on an mdpi device (with 160dpi screen) is equal to 1px. Just fill in 160dpi and you get px = dp * (160 / 160), which simplifies to px = dp * 1, and hence px = dp for 160dpi. QED. :)
10360735	I have a property that I'll call index. I have a mutable array that I'll call array. I'm shocked to find this code throws an index out of bounds exception? However, this variant works:I expect for loops to operate like so: I expect the following sequence: The initialization instructions are executedExecute code in for loopBreak if condition returns false/0. otherwise, execute nextiteration instruction. Then go to 2.This tells me the for loops do not necessarily check the condition prior to executing the next iteration code (as is in C/C++). So, I'm curious whether there are multiple schools of thought on the order of operations of the for loop. If not, this tells me I have more complicated issues to address. Thanks.
10360776	Are you incrementing index within the for loop in the first case?If this is the case then your syntax is messed up in the third section of your for loop where you set self.item = [array objectAtIndex:index] and that is exactly where the exception is being thrown because this part gets executed before the comparison of index &lt; [array count] takes place and breaks you out of the loop.Why don't you just have your for loop defined as this?The first time through you will get the CONDITION checked first, but then the incrementer is running at the end of each iteration of the loop. At that point it goes INCREMENTER -> CONDITION -> loop_body.It's the equivalent of the following:

10361090	If you have enabled PHP you could do the following:
10361516	The code you wrote does not what you expect.To iterate through an array, you should consider the for-in loop:The for-loop you are using is wrong in several manners and it is (quite) obvious why you exceed the limits of the array:In the last valid cycle you are increasing the index, then the for-instruction will execute the third argument of for: In that very moment, index is larger than the array bounds, since the condition (second argument of the for-instruction) will be executed afterwards.
10364458	I recently came across the @font-family CSS rule as I was looking to use web fonts on my website.Coming to the point, I've seen two variants in @font-family CSS code, which you can see below:and this is another:Compare the lines that I've commented with /* NOTE THIS LINE */The first variant is by Google Web Fonts, while the second one is by Font Squirrel. So, is one of these two wrong? (Just wanted to confirm, although both are very reliable sources.)If acceptable, which one of the two would I be better off with?
10364852	I use the option at Google Web Fonts to use the@importoption. It may take some time to load but if peformance is what you want you can probably host the fonts yourself. As for Font Squirrel I'm quite not familiar with it, but I'll check it out.
10365069	the first example, though hard to believe, is correct; notice how the Droid Serif Regular is being declared as font weight normal and font style normal...how you'd expect a regular font to be displayed. the second declaration, it's calling in Droid Serif Italic, and setting it to to font-style:italic; this allows you to use multiple fonts within a family. If you wanted to add a bold font, you'd apply the same @font-face rule except you'd change font-weight:bold, while leaving font-style:normal and declaring the same font family. fontsquirrel really does a great job with rendering @font-face rules, actually i've read about this technique there. surprised it's not being implemented. you can read more about this here:

10367249	No, PHP does not work with CSS, but using templating engines or str_replace or preg_replace you can output the CSS in a &lt;style&gt; tag in the HTML. It's not the best idea though.

10373076	foreach doesn't always copy. when it does copy, it copies only the immediate data structure being iterated; it doesn't copy any values. for example, if you didif there were 100 sub elements (you abbreviated one as [x] ), then it would make an array, copy those 100 keys, but would not copy the values that the keys point to, the values being the sub arrays/trees. internally it just stores a pointer and has it point to the subarray's memory address, without copying.I think you're making a big deal for nothing, as the amount of data that actually gets copied is very little. foreach is almost always very very fast...if you want to glimpse, look at memory_get_usage() and memory_get_peak_usage() before and after your loop.
10377227	simple trim would be enough:$string = trim($string, " ,");Note that the second parameter of trim() function allows you to trim defined characters from your string, not just the whitespace. Therefore there are two chars defined in my usage: The space character " " and the comma ",".and if you look for capitalizing the words without a loop:$string = ucwords(trim($string, " ,"));Note: as ucwords() function looks for whitespace to define word boundaries, "apple,apple" won't work but "apple, apple" would work, so:$string = ucwords(str_replace(array(","," "),array(", "," "),trim($string, " ,")));is the best solution. (There are two spaces in the second element of first replacement array.)

10416172	The problem almost certainly is that the recreated keyspace is inconsistent with the commit log or data stored with the original definition. Shut down the Cassandra server and clear out the commitlog, saved_caches, and data directory corresponding to the keyspace. The locations of these directories are in cassandra.yaml - look for data_file_directories, saved_caches_directory, and commitlog_directory.
10416608	This problem is due to inconsistency and you can go for following steps.1) In your case this is OK to clear "data" , "saved_caches" and "commitlog" directories as you dont have any critical data and other Keyspaces.2) In the scenarios where you have some critical data and you can not delete above mentioned directories do the following.Use nodetool drain to Empty the commitlog on all the nodes of the cluster.Then delete all the "LocationInfo*" files from "/data/system" directories and restart the cluster.

I tested this with a foreach loop through $_SESSION and it prints when INCLUDING the page, but doesn't on redirect.I'm kinda pulling my hair out over this because I really do need to use session variables after redirects.File Structure:index.php = submits login form => login_code.php = redirects after setting session vars => user_dash.php echos vars and nothing shows (empty vars, if statement to echo if isset)I have removed the redirects and even simple hyperlinks aren't carrying my session variables to the next page.Live HTTP Header:

This title is getting truncated.I have tried:"My Superlong\nTitle""My Superlong&amp;#xA;Title"but neither worked: \n and &amp;#xA were displayed as part of the Title. Is it possible to have a line break/newline in my title? Thanks!
10424242	Figured it out! $wpdb-&gt;print_error() prints that error string even if there isn't an error. SO you have to check explicitly to see if the query returned false - not 0.
10424538	Have you tried:just to see if it works with a short String? I think that there's a character limit for Titles and a line break would count towards that character limit.
10424614	No, you have very little control over the Settings.bundle and a multiline title is not an option. Best thing to do would be to cut down the cell title and create a group title, or group footer.
10439713	I'm getting this error and sure how to fix it, I'm trying to create a loader class that inherits from the Default1, then to use its in the method. Any help appreciated
10439751	Your code is not evaluate.Interface is (of normal) to start with the Inot requirement for the build, yet common as the LAWjust go IDefault !PRASHANT :)
10439764	I think you are confused here about how to define and/or implement interfaces.What you have there is a class, named Default1, which is defining an internal, nested interface named Default1. There are three problems with this:You can't do that; the names cannot be the same because it creates possible ambiguity with the names. The error message was pretty clear here. (As others have stated, interfaces are usually called ISomething, which resolves the name conflict.That interface is defined in a strange way; it is nested inside an internal (thanks @FishBasketGordo for reminding me!) class. That means it's only visible inside the assembly where you defined it, and it has to be referenced as Default1.IDefault (assuming you fixed the name).Nothing is actually implementing your interface, so it is not being used anywhere.If you want to define an interface, you don't need a class:If you want your class to implement that interface:

In doing so the server can determine the appropriate image size to send to the client.My company has successfully implemented this with iPhone and Android client's retrieving images that are smaller in size as opposed to browser's on laptops receiving larger images.Good luck!
10459708	I tried using preg_match_all to get all the contents between a given html tag but it produces an empty result and I'm not good at php.Is there a way to get get contents between tags? Like this -
10459726	Try this with preg_match
10459998	preg_match is not very good at HTML parsing, especially in your case which is a bit more complex.Instead you use a HTML parser and obtain the elements you're looking for. The following is a simple example selecting the first span element. This can be more differentiated by looking for the class attribute as well for example, just to give you some pointers for the start:Output:If you look closely, you can see that even HTML errors have been fixed on the fly with the &amp;+++ which was not valid HTML.If you only need the inner HTML, you need to iterate over the children of the span element:Which give you:I hope this is helpful.

10464608	There's a problem with signing the setup.exe yourself. I ran into this when writing ClickOnce articles for the P&amp;P guys at MSFT. There is no workaround for it. Is your certificate installed in the cert store for the user account you're using to generate the deployment? Is it specified as a file in the VS solution itself? If it's the default, and you generate the deployment using msbuild and mage, does it come out signed okay?

How to write a functiona test should read the document here. https://github.com/playframework/Play20/wiki/JavaTestTesting your applicationTest source files must be placed in your application’s test folder.

10508888	What you are looking for can probably best be accomplished with a lock file. By lock file I simply mean a file that will have a predefined location and whose existence is your mutex.Test if that file exists when your program starts, if it does, exit immediately. Create a file in a known location. If your program exits normally, delete the lock file. Probably best is if you can also populate the file with a pid (process id) so that you can detect abnormal exits that didn't delete the file but this get OS specific.

Here is the code:What I can actually get from the other server is the following:I can assign the array values to a variable but it will only assign the first ones, so for example: if i put this in the function and echo it out  $id = $main_content_fetch['content']; echo $id;all I get back is 'Array', what I actually want is the 'BLAH BLAH BLAH TXT TXT TXT' thats located later in the returned info, we actually everything thats located in the last set of brackets... ( [type] => Heading1 [content] => BLAH BLAH BLAH TXT TXT TXT [scope] => DetailAndThumb [active] => 1 [reference] => [name] => accblurb ) [1] => Array ( [type] => Image [align] => Left [image] =>  [thumb] =>  [scope] => DetailAndThumb [active] => 1 [reference] => [name] => accshop1.jpg )What I want to do is to be able to assign basically everything I get back to a variable, as it is. because I think Ill be able to pick what I want out easily enough.. and I don't know of any other way to do it :/Sorry if its a bit vague, Not very good at explaining myself, but I hope someone can workout what I'm talking about and help.
10514292	This is your function. I just replaced print_r with returnlets say you call this function like this. Now you can assign the array in individual variable this wayHope this helps you. All you need is assign array variable with index to the variable you wish.
10514325	First use print_r($arr, TRUE) to print your array when debugging, that will help you a lot :-) (don't forget the TRUE flag!).You can access any item in the array as you did, but it looks like you're printing $main_content_fetch instead of $main_content_b_render?

10515310	You can always use URL re-writing to store the chosen cultural preference of the user. Not particularly sure how this is achieved in ASP.Net, but it's easy using the routing table in MVC.To elucidate, your url would look something like this: As a solution, this removes the overhead of sessions, the possibility that someone has turned cookies off in the browser, and the unsightly QueryString that gets generated.I'll try and get back with an example of how to do the url re-writing.
10515323	As often, it depends on your particular use case.Most often however you'd probably want to have a different URL for each page and language in order to have it indexed properly by search engines. For example URL's like:I prefer the first 2 options.Optionally, you could redirect the user based on their browser language when they first arrive on your site (but please make sure that the user still can browse the other languages).Update: This doesn't mean you'll have to make as many versions of your site as you have languages.If you have a subdomain for each language:Point each subdomain to your siteIn the codebehind of your pages, you override the InitializeCulture method (you may use a base class for all pages in order to keep it DRY)Set the appropriate culture in the overridden InitializeCulture methodCreate your resource filesUse the resources in your pages - the correct translation will be displayed depending on the culture.If you decide not to use subdomains but include the culture name in your URL, you may use URL-rewriting to point to the same page from each URL.Some code to get you started:

10544339	I think you could override the onKeyDown() method, make it do nothing but return true. It should catch the keypresses from the keyboard and negate them before they can go into the text in the EditText.You might also try setting editable to false like thison the EditText in your xml layout. However I am not certain if this will let you still highlight and copy, but it is worth a shot.
10546071	Previously my WPF Application size was 4096KB as a single .exe file.Now i have splitted the application as multiple like thisI am further thinking to add two more dll by removing the viewmodels from JIMS.exe into JIMS.ViewModel.dll.Now my question is, Is this a good way to spit Single EXE into multiple dlls,Please let me know what are the advantages and disadvantages of this.I have some opinion like, if there are more dlls, JIMS.exe will struggle to contact many dlls using the application. Since for each call it has to read respective dlls.Thanks in advance.
10546131	It is good to split applications in multiple dll. That makes the project more easy to manage, easier to add/remove features and easier to write a completly new application using the existing dll.I think dynamic linking is better for the application.....Good Things About Dynamic CALLsYou don't need to relink your application if you change something in your subroutine; only the subroutine DLL needs to be relinked.All executables that call this subroutine will share the same DLL; both the code and data. Since your application only loads one copy of a dynamically called subroutine, it uses less memory.Changes in values contained within the dynamically called subroutine are available to all the DLLs that use it, because they all share the same copy of the subroutine.You can free memory that a dynamically called subroutine was using by CANCELing the subroutine. This is, however, not generally of much use in the 32-bit Windows virtual-memory environment, since Windows will 'page out' inactive data from the computer's real memory pool anyway.List itemBad Things About Dynamic CALLsEvery dynamically called subroutine must be linked as a DLL (unless you use an import library to expose other entry points in a DLL). Therefore, if you application consists of hundreds of subroutines and they're all called dynamically, you will need to distribute hundreds of DLLs.It's possible to mix versions of your DLLs. This can be a problem both with distributing your application and with end-users installing updates improperly.If one of your DLLs is missing, you may not know about it until the user exercises some facility that tries to call that DLL. At that point, your application will terminate abnormally unless you handle this situation.If you CALL a DLL, CANCEL it, then CALL it again, you incur more I/O because the routine needs to be reloaded if you CANCEL it. This can slow down an application because it requires more disk activity. Again, in the Windows environment this is usually unnecessary because Windows does an excellent job of managing memory.If you mix and match static and dynamic calls to the same subroutine, your software might have several different versions in memory at once. Guess how much fun it will be trying to debug THAT mess?For more info see Here
10548207	I haven't seen it mentioned, so I'll chip in.In my experience, the main reason to use this approach in C# is exchangeability - to easily be able to replace parts of the system.To give an example, we use this approach in my current project. Each GUI component (or UserControl) is its own dll, and is dynamically imported at launch. This allows us to implement a plugin-architecture for our GUI as well as allowing our GUI Developers to work in separate projects and not have to load all the logic/etc.I can't tell you if it's "good" or "bad" - it's what you need for your specific purpose. What I can tell you is that it's not "wrong".

10605173	You know that PHP is installed and working since phpinfo() is showing properly. This leads to the assumption that it is your specific configuration of a script that is not working.Make sure that the PHP module is listed and uncommented insideof your Apache's httpd.conf. This should be something like LoadModulephp5_module "c:/php/php5apache2_2.dll" in the file. Make sure that the http.conf file has the PHP MIME type in it.

10610459	Apparently, C# is as susceptible to '>>' lexer dilemma as is C++.This C# code is pretty valid, it compiles and runs just fine:You'd have to overload '&lt;' and '>>' operators for the Dummy class above.But the compiler manages to guess that in 'x' case the meaning is to use List, Nullable and Guid local variables. And in 'y' case it suddenly decides to treat them as names of well-known types.Here's a bit more detailed description with another example:The question is: how does C# compiler resolve 'a&lt;b&lt;c>>' to arithmetic expression or generic type/method?Surely it doesn't try to have multiple 'goes' over the text of the program until it succeeds, or does it? That would require unbounded look-ahead, and a very complex too.
10610850	EDIT: I insist there's no ambiguity:In your example there's no ambiguity at all. This could never be evaluated as a List&lt;Guid?&gt;. The context (the extra 10) shows the compiler how to interpret it.Would the compiler compile this?:It's clear it wouldn't. So Im'm still looking for the ambiguity.OTOH, the second expression:has to be evaluated as a List&lt;Guid?&gt;, because you're invoking the .Equals method. Again, this can be interpreted in any other way.There is no paradox at all. The compiler parses it perfectly. I'm still wondering which the apradox is.You're on a big mistake. The compiler interprets whole expressions, and uses the language grammar to understand them. It doesn't look at a fragment of code, like you're doing, without taking the rest of the expression into account.These expressions are parsed according to C# grammar. And the grammar is clear enough to interpret the code correctly. I.e. in It's clear that 10 is a literal. If you follow up the grammar you'll find this: 10 is a *literal, so it's *primary-no-array-creation-expression, which is a *primary-expression, which is a *unary-expression, which is a *multiplicative-expression, which is an *additive-expression. If you look for an additive expression on the right side of a *>>, you find it must be a *shift-expression, so the left side of the *>> must be interpreted as an *additive-expression and so on. If you were able to find a different way to use the grammar and get a different result for the same expression, then, I would have to agree with you, but let me disagree! Finally:is very confusing for humansis absolutely clear and unambiguous to the compilerBecause:we humans identify patterns taking fragments of the whole text which are familiar to us, like List&lt;Nullable&lt;Guid&gt;&gt; and interpret them like we wantcompilers doesn't interptret the code like us, taking familiar fragments like List&lt;Nullable&lt;Guid&gt;&gt;. They take the whole expression and match it to the language grammar.

Now, as listView items start getting removed i run into problems because that ID for a specific thread has changed..Here is the code i currently use to update and remove:I now understand that i cannot use the threadNumber as the item index (as items get removed) is there any other way i could achieve this? maybe by targeting the "user" subitem? and then getting subitems from that?

10625135	I've been directed to the paragraph 7.6.4.2 in C# language spec: The productions for simple-name (§7.6.2) and member-access (§7.6.4) can give rise to ambiguities in the grammar for expressions.... If a sequence of tokens can be parsed (in context) as a simple-name (§7.6.2), member-access (§7.6.4), or pointer-member-access (§18.5.2) ending with a type-argument-list (§4.4.1), the token immediately following the closing > token is examined. If it is one of  ( ) ] } : ; , . ? == != | ^  then the type-argument-list is retained as part of the simple-name, member-access or pointer-member-access and any other possible parse of the sequence of tokens is discarded. Otherwise, the type-argument-list is not considered to be part of the simple-name, member-access or pointer-member-access, even if there is no other possible parse of the sequence of tokens. Note that these rules are not applied when parsing a type-argument-list in a namespace-or-type-name (§3.8).So, there may indeed an ambiguity arise when type-argument-list is involved, and they've got a cheap way to resolve it, by looking one token ahead.It's still an unbound look ahead, because there might be a megabyte worth of comments between '>>' and following token, but at least the rule is more or less clear. And most importantly there is no need for speculative deep parsing.
10627421	I think there are a couple issues here. One is the formatting, and the way simple_form adds a &lt;div&gt; around the input field. @Ron's suggestion of using input_field works for me with simple_form 2.0.1. My example is searching for name in a Contacts table. The following makes the text box and button appear side by side:The other issue is that it seems simple_form usually assumes you want to work with model and field names. The example above uses a :symbol instead of a @model as the first argument as suggested here. But that still generates an input field named contact[search] so you'd have to tell your controller how to deal with that.I think in this case it may be simpler to not use simple_form and instead use something like the form near the beginning of Ryan Bates' Railscast #240, Search, Sort, Paginate with AJAX:Now the field is just named "search" and I can consume it in my controller's #index method something like this:assuming I have this in my model:

10651040	Possible Duplicate: Check if third-party cookies are enabled I wonder if anyone can helpWe have a large ecommerce web application, where customers pay with a credit card. To capture and process the credit card, we display an iframe whose scr attribute is the payment provider. IE. our app does not capture and process the card and payment itself - we hand that off to a 'specialist' (loose sense of the word!) provider, and they hand us back payment confirmation etc.For the most part this works fine. However we have discovered recently that the process requires 3rd-party cookies to be enabled on the browser. Unfortunately our Chairman discovered it when using Safari. Consequently its massively high profile, and the initial knee jerk reaction from the Business was "we must detect Safari and show a message about enabling 3rd party cookies" :(I've kicked back on that beacuse its nothing to do with Safari, and have proved that the same problem happens on any browser without 3rd party cookie support.The core problem is with our payment provider partner, in that their process requires this. I dont know why they require it, they are looking into it. However, between now and next millenium when they might come back with an answer, I need to have something in place.Ideally what I want to do is on a page before the card capture, detect no support for 3rd party cookies, and display an overlay/redirect to another page/whatever. But I cant work out how to reliably detect whether 3rd party cookies are enabled.To clarify, I'm not looking to bypass any browser/user security or privacy settings, or do anything underhanded. The problem is at the moment, without 3PC support (I've got fed up of typing 3rd party cookie :) ) the user gets an empty page within the iframe. At that point the processing is still in the payment providers domain, so I cant detect that its happened. What I want to do is detect that its likely to happen (ie. you dont have 3PC enabled) and show you a nice dialog/screen saying why we need them enabled, and how you can enable them. The customer can choose then whether to enable 3PC and continue with the purchase, or call our call centre to complete the purchase, or simply go away. Its a better user experience all round.Thats the plan anyway :) - so ... anyone know how I can detect if the browser has 3PC enabled?Appreciate your thoughts,CheersNathan
10652482	if you are talking about Code than you can use this&lt;script type="text/javascript" &gt;document.cookie = "TemporaryTestCookie=yes;";if(document.cookie.indexOf("TemporaryTestCookie=") == -1) { alert("Cookies are not enabled in this browser ");}else { alert ("Cookies are enabled in this browser");}&lt;/script&gt;the thing which you are looking for is here

10718009	what is the difference between the working of two ? For WH_KEYBOARD_LL i read that it Installs a hook procedure that monitors low-level keyboard input events. What is meant by low-level keyboard events ?
10719138	Meh, don't focus too much on the term, it doesn't clarify anything. There's a huge difference between the two. WH_KEYBOARD_LL installs a hook that requires the callback to be implemented in your own program. And you must pump a message loop so that Windows can make the callback whenever it is about to dispatch a keyboard message. Which makes it really easy to get going.WH_KEYBOARD works very differently, it requires a DLL that can be safely injected into hooked processes. Which makes it notoriously difficult to get going, injecting DLLs without affecting a process isn't easy. Particularly on a 64-bit operating system. Nor is taking care of the inter-process communication you might need if some other process needs to know about the keystroke. Like a key logger.The advantage of WH_KEYBOARD is that it has access to the keyboard state. Which is a per-process property in Windows. State like the active keyboard layout and the state of the modifier and dead keys matter a great deal when you want to use the hook to translate virtual keys to typing keys yourself. You can't reliably call ToUnicodeEx() from an external process.You can't swing a cat without running into example code, google will give you plenty. So be sure to use something known-to-work if you have never written such a hook before, it will avoid a lot of grief.
10719167	I'd bet this relates to the make-code and break-codes PC keyboards send. You get a separate event for "LEFT-CTRL pushed down", "A pushed down", "A released", "LEFT-CTRL released", while a higher-level would tell you "CTRL+A pressed".

Then I try and combine this with a parent select statement to get rows with the dates outputted by the above that are in the 'DAY' (of Oracle type DATE) column.Which gives no results, despite knowing that there are rows that have the dates generated by the above.I've read that when using the 'IN' operator, values must be enclosed in single quotes, but I'm not sure about how to do this with the query above.Am I going about this the right way by using the IN operator, or should I be doing a different type of nested query?

10740862	It may be what you want
10741280	You declared the struct as a class in C#. That's fine, but it means that any variable of that type is already a reference. So you don't need to pass by ref. When you pass a class by ref you end up passing a pointer to a pointer to the object. That's one level of indirection too many.The P/invoke in the C# code should therefore be like this:The other way to fix it is to leave the ref in the function declaration, but to declare the temp type as a struct rather than a class. That's because a struct is a value type. A variable whose type is a struct is a value rather than a reference.Both solutions work, it's up to you which you choose. There is another problem in your C++ code.You are passing p and q, which are of type std::string to printf and expecting the %s format string to print them. That's an error. You need to call c_str() on the strings. Like this:The problem with your update is that long is 32 bits in Windows C++ and 64 bits in C#. You need to declare it as int in C#.

Change the last 'return false' into 'return true' and it will submit.Edit:Misread your code, you have to change 'onclick="return claim()"' into 'onSubmit="return claim()'" and move that to the form tag.Edit 2:Misunderstood the question, you have to say 'return true' where you want to submit, so replace you jquery.submit with return true.
10765500	You made the following mistakes:jQuery selector 'form' is too general and returns an array. So change it to '#myform'.Also your javascript never allows your form to be submitted.

10823152	One big problem: C arrays are indexed from 0, unlike MATLAB arrays which are 1-based. So you need to change your loop fromtoA second, big problem - you're mixing single precision (float) and double precision (double) routines. Your data is double so you should be using vDSP_ctozD, not vDSP_ctoz, and vDSP_fft_zripD rather than vDSP_fft_zrip, etc.Another thing to watch out for: different FFT implementations use different definitions of the DFT formula, particularly in regard to scaling factor. It looks like the MATLAB FFT includes a 1/N scaling correction, which most other FFTs do not.Here is a complete working example whose output matches Octave (MATLAB clone):Output is:Comparing with Octave we get:Note that the outputs from 9 to 16 are just a complex conjugate mirror image or the bottom 8 terms, as is the expected case with a real-input FFT.Note also that we needed to scale the vDSP FFT by a factor of 2 - this is due to the fact that it's a real-to-complex FFT, which is based on an N/2 point complex-to-complex FFT, hence the outputs are scaled by N/2, whereas a normal FFT would be scaled by N.

10837818	I think you just have a race condition whereby the ajax requests are completing too late. The only way to get around this is to have methods that depend on the requests run after they complete. There are a lot of ways to do this such as using Deferred and $.when. The simple way would be nice:In the .each you are depending on multiple requests -- possibly a lot at a time. I would try to do this in one request (e.g. update your server code to accept a list of items and compute the subtotal instead of just having them one at a time). Otherwise, you have to update the subtotal continuously, which may cause it to flicker visually. It's also inefficient for the server.

10838967	The action parameter in the login form page is interpreted as a URL relative to the URL of the login page, so when you submit the form the browser sends a POST request to the server with the URL /[context-path]/ProviderManager/j_security_check. The servlet container uses /[context-path]/j_security_check as the path for authentication requests to your webapp.Any one of the following should fix this:Change the action parameter in the login page to ../j_security_check.Change the action parameter in the login page to /[context-root]/j_security_checkMove the login page to the application context root directory.

10851466	I have a MySQL table containing the points (x/y coordinates) of tracks. Each row contains the TrackID, a Timestamp, and the X and Y Positions for that track at that given point in time.What I want is a list of all TrackIDs that were active during a given time interval (tmin...tmax), sorted by their start-time, even if that start time is outside the interval.A little illustration might help:As an example: Track 1 is active from t11 till t12, which means I have many rows in my table with ID=1 and with timestamps ranging from t11 to t12.The desired output would be:I tried something like this:However, in the example above I don't get the real start times for tracks 1 and 7, since all rows with timestamps less than tmin are not considered at all.Of course I could in a first step just get all active TrackIDs withand then with separate queries find the start times of all these tracks and then sort them in my application code.But I'm sure there is a way to do this with one SQL query. My table contains millions of rows, so efficiency is an issue here.I hope someone can show me a solution (and explain it, since I'd like to learn SQL better...)!
10851573	You were on the right track with your second query, you just need to add an ORDER BY clause.
10851578	Take a look at your picture - all the ranges you want have ending time greater than min and starting time less than max.

10854534	Given a long sequence of N (not necessary distinct) numbers, sayand a small set of M ordered pairs, sayI would like to detect whether the ordered pair occurs anywhere in the list (they could be separated, but order matters). For example, the counts above would be:Assuming that every number in the ordered pairs is guaranteed to appear in the list, does there exist an algorithm to extract these counts faster than the naive O(N * M) time (achieved by brute force searching for each ordered pair)?As a side question, might there be a fast algorithm if we restrict ourselves to boolean occurrences only instead of counts? That is:Any help would be appreciated.
10854617	Suppose all number are different don't you think that brute force solution is the only solution.
10854670	Keep two hashes, one mapping numbers to the least position at which they occur, and one mapping numbers to the greatest position at which they occur. The ordered pair (a, b) appears in order if least[a] &lt; greatest[b] (and both hash keys are present). Preprocessing time is linear, space usage is linear, query time is constant (under standard assumptions about the complexity of hashing).As for the counting version, the best I can think of is to keep one hash mapping each number to the positions at which it occurs in sorted order. To query a pair, "merge" the position lists, keeping track of the number of a-elements so far and the number of pair occurrences. When a b-element is selected to be next, increment the number of pairs by the number of a-elements. When an a-element is selected to be next, increment the number of a-elements. (If a == b, return length choose 2.)

Imagine I would like to put all my examples closer to the root only by one level. That would be impossible, because I would have to update more than 30 examples and many times within each example. To this:My solution would be to have a special case for root based: if a string starts with an $ then it's relative to the root folder of the project.Any help is appreciated, thanksUpdate 2Now I'm using require.js which allows you to write in one way and works both on client and on server. Require.js also allows you to create custom paths.
10860460	I don't think you need to solve this in the manner you described. Just sed if you want to change the same string in a large amount of files. In your example,would have ../../ changed to ../Alternatively, you can require a configuration file that stores a variable containing the path to the library. If you store the following as config.js in the example directoryvar config = {};config.path = '../../';and in your example filemyConfiguration = require('./config');express = require(config.path);You'll be able to control the configuration for every example from one file.It's really just personal preference.
10861719	The big pictureIt seems "really bad" but give it time. It is, in fact, really good. The explicit require()s give a total transparency and ease of understanding that is like a breath of fresh air during a project life cycle.Think of it this way: You are reading an example, dipping your toes into Node.js and you've decided it is "really bad IMO." You are second-guessing leaders of the Node.js community, people who have logged more hours writing and maintaining Node.js applications than anyone. What is the chance the author made such a rookie mistake? (And I agree, from my Ruby and Python background, it seems at first like a disaster.)There is a lot of hype and counter-hype surrounding Node.js. But when the dust settles, we will acknowledge that explicit modules and "local first" packages were a major driver of adoption.The common caseOf course, node_modules from the current directory, then the parent, then grandparent, great-grandparent, etc. is searched. So packages you have installed already work this way. Usually you can require("express") from anywhere in your project and it works fine.If you find yourself loading common files from the root of your project (perhaps because they are common utility functions), then that is a big clue that it's time to make a package. Packages are very simple: move your files into node_modules/ and put a package.jsonthere. Voila! Everything in that namespace is accessible from your entire project. Packages are the correct way to get your code into a global namespace.Other workaroundsI personally don't use these techniques, but they do answer your question, and of course you know your own situation better than I.You can set $NODE_PATH to your project root. That directory will be searched when you require().Next, you could compromise and require a common, local file from all your examples. That common file simply re-exports the true file in the grandparent directory.examples/downloads/app.js (and many others like it)examples/downloads/express.jsNow when you relocate those files, the worst-case is fixing the one shim module.

(GetService is not a known method call) I tried adding Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell (and Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.10.0) but it did not help.In looking around on the internet I found that you need a IServiceProvider to call this.But all the examples that show how to get an IServiceProvider use a EnvDTE.So, to get the current EnvDTE I need IServiceProvider. But to get an IServiceProvider I need an EnvDTE. (There is a hole in my bucket...)So, here is my question:In a normal WPF Application, how can I get the current instance of EnvDTE?NOTE: I am not looking for any old instance of EnvDTE.

10866444	I'm working on a textfield working with the kind of validation that wouldn't let you enter other than numeric values. As so, my initial code looked quite simple and similar to this:This is fairly strightforward, but turns that (in the latest version of all browsers) Firefox will make this also prevent movement with the arrow keys and delete/backspace keys, whereas the other browsers would not.Looking around I found that I would need to also check for these keys, and check for different properties exposed in the e event reference.My final code looks something like this:However, this feels to be too much to solve a fairly simple problem as just preventing non-numeric.What am I doing wrong? Which is the best practice in terms of this kind of validation?
10866473	We'll respond to both keypresses, and the blur event. When somebody press a key, we check to see if the key entered is a number. If it is, we permit it. Otherwise, we prevent it.If the field is blurred, we remove any non-numerical values, and all those values that follow. This will prevent the user from pasting in non-numerical strings:Demo:

10881651	I want to upgrade and make more systematic, my protection against sql injection attacks. I gather the three main methods are pdo, prepared statements and mysql_escape_string, that pdo is considered best but mysql_escape_string considered adequate if you are meticulous. I don't think I am ready to go to PDO or prepared statements as I have a lot of complicated queries involving multiple tables so this would be a huge task. But I want to make use of mysql_escape_string more programmatic.Rather than escape every individual variable that users submit, I was thinking of escape the SQL commands with a standard function that might require some modification to handle punctuation Is this a sound approach or will escaping the whole query create problems-I do use apostrophes, backticks and %, for example. It would seem that a standard function for every sql statement would be more systematic and standard than the variable by variable approach. So question is what modifications to handle punctuation might be needed? Also, is there anything else that ought to go into the function such as htmlspecialchars and strip_tags as I gather mysql_escape_string is not 100% complete? Here is basic function.
10881695	I don't think I am ready to go to PDO or prepared statements as I have a lot of complicated queries involving multiple tables so this would be a huge task.Huge? Perhaps. Worth the effort though. will escaping the whole query create problemsYes. Your function will have no way of knowing if a piece of SQL is an injection attack or something you intended.You have to escape text at the point where it is inserted into SQL. You can't insert text into SQL and then figure out which bit was SQL and which bit was text afterwards. is there anything else that ought to go into the function such as htmlspecialchars and strip_tagsstrip_tags throws data away. I wouldn't use it.Both strip_tags and htmlspecialchars offer protection against unsafe data being inserted into an HTML document. Use them before inserting data into an HTML document, not before inserting data into SQL.

10889138	really a simple question , I have two Variables "one_hour_ago" and "current_time", I need to pass these two variables in my sql command like : here is what I have but I get syntax error Thanks
10889211	EDIT: this is just what OP explicitly asked for, for a better (right) answer take a look at Jane Doe's...EDIT 2: For all those ignoramuses that downvoted me, "one_hour_ago" and "current_time" are clearly not user entered strings (but his own DateTime vars), and can be in any case made completely foolproof with just a simple TryParse before using them (and that is all that sql parameters do too in that regard, there is no added magic to it). Now, string concatenating a sql cmd is wrong, but I didn't suggest it, I merely just corrected his own approach to it. And I could have warned him about sql injection, but seeing as how he had problems with a simple string operation, I just judged it to be the least of his problems (right now), and assumed that it would only confuse him further to no end.
10889216	I'm slightly confused as to the proper conventions when dealing with properties. I'll illustrate my question through an example. So from the example below I know that functionally "self.loan = self.loan + 250.00;" is the same as "_loan = _loan + 250.00;" or is it not? I see numerous tutorials all over the web that may or may not use both methods to access a property. So what exactly is the difference between using _loan and self.loan (I know that self.loan is the same as [self setLoan:])
10889296	_loan is a variable and assigning a value to it has no particular side effect.self.loan = self.loan + 250.00 is essentially the same as writing [self setLoan:[self loan] + 250.00] in that methods are called that may do other things than simply set or get the value of a variable. The extra things those methods do depend on whether you write custom versions of them (the setters and the getters) or use @synthesize to create them and, if you use @synthesize, what attributes you apply in the @property declaration.
10889301	where date_before and currentTime are the parameters you pass to the method.this should take care of the sql injection stuff
10890618	You should never use direct reference to a variable when accessing a property. Always go for self.property in your code.If you use _property you are not making use for your getters and setters. In this case you are just wasting @synthesize use.self.loan = self.loan + 250.00; //Exhibit AThis should be right approach.
10891761	I have been using C++ and Java for several years now. One thing which I can't seem to understand is that why do we need to provide constructors of a class a name? For instance, if I have to define a class FOO in C++/Java, I'll be forced to provide FOO as the constructor name. However, since constructor is never explicitly called, what is the sense in compiler forcing me to provide it a name after all. The abstraction paradigm dictates, we hide unnecessary details from programmers. This is the reason, constructors don't have a return type, since it's already well-defined what a constructor has to return. In the same spirit, why can't we just give a generic name to constructors of all classes - for instance anything meaningful, like initialize() or maybe just nothing and just arguments ( [arg [,arg]] ) I hope, I'm able to express myself. If someone have any definitive answers, kindly let me know.
10891780	since you can't call the constructor explicitly, what's the purpose of giving a special name to it? and about constuctors having a name same with the class: constructing can only be performed in a function so constructor is a function. and since it's a special function, among other class functions it should have a special signature. language designers wanted them to be named same with the class.
10891966	In C++ constructors do not have names(C++03 12.1), however since constructors are essentially defined as functions, it was logical to name them in some way.Naming them anything other than the class name would have added new keywords and hence eventually they were named same as the class name.In short, It was a logical decision which avoided new keywords and at the same time ensured intuitiveness.
10905284	In my previous post undefined method `find&#39; for AWS::S3::Bucket:Class we figured out that the Amazon S3 uploader I was creating required aws-s3 gem, but I also had aws-sdk gem installed and those two conflict with each other.The problem is that I am also using Paperclip and after removing aws-sdk, I found that my app broke.Is there a workaround?

10910850	Set the autofocus attribute on the control. Note that this requires a browser that supports that particular bit of the HTML 5 draft.It is also possible to set it with JavaScript, but that can interfere with normal use of the page (especially with screen readers which use the focus point to read from) (so can the autofocus attribute, but it is at least standard so screen reader software can be written to work around it).The JavaScript technique I don't recommend is:Note that this does not use the onload event. That event doesn't fire until the entire document, including dependancies such as images, is loaded so there is usually a significant delay in which the user might start interacting with the page. Setting the focus after that point is likely to break whatever the user is in the middle of.
10910870	You can set the focus. If you dont use any external libraries (like jQuery) try this:

10931631	Is it correct to require_once?where and how would you put it include path?Should it not be in a application.ini or bootstrap?EXAMPLE:
10931753	It is not correct in this case.First off, please use Zend Tool. It will create the files you don't know how to create yourself. It will create the correct class names, extend them appropriately and require_once anything that might be needed.Do not place require_once in the bootstrap. You want it to execute only when needed, not with every request.As for the example you've provided, the correct version would be:The class that is extended by the helper is autoloaded and putting it in require_once does nothing.
10933376	Generally speaking, you can avoid require_once calls almost entirely by appropriately using Zend_Loader_Autoloader. Of course, the key is "appropriate".Typically, your public/index.php sets the include_path to be the library folder. Then, if you are using Zend_Application, the Zend_Loader_Autoloader is registered to find any PSR-0 compliant classes whose namespace prefixes have been registered using the autoloadernamespaces array in application/configs/application.ini.The tricky part is for classes defined in files that don't "reside on the include_path", like models that appear in application/models, services that reside in application/services, etc. Even though the classes defined there tend to follow PSR-0 standards, the fact that the PSR-0 mapping occurs relative to a base off the include-path means that the system has to know the mapping between classname prefixes and base paths. This is where resource autoloaders come in. These resource autoloaders are typically set up automatically in the application Bootstrap extending Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Bootstrap and module bootstraps that extend Zend_Application_Module_Bootstrap.View helpers are another example of classes that reside "off the include_path", perhaps in something like application/views/helpers. Since these are typically invoked in a view script using a short form $this-&gt;someHelper($someParam), the system must be told how to generate the fully qualified classname from this short name. This is accomplished using $view-&gt;addPrefixPath() which maps namespace prefixes to filesystem locations. Again, the app-level and module level bootstrapping mechanism sets most of these up for you.For libraries/classes that do not follow PSR-0 standards, you can create custom autoloaders and attach them (typically at Bootstrap) to the Zend_Loader_Autoloader singleton. This is the only place where you would have an explicit include/require.tl;dr: With proper use of the existing ZF autoloader mechanism, you almost never need to have include/require statements in your own application code.
10938464	One suggestion that I have is to incorporate a decimal datatype instead of using a combination of fields. For example, instead of having a table with Date (YYYYMMDD), Store (SSSS), and Item (IIII), I would recommend...YYYYMMDD.SSSSIIII. Especially when querying multiple tables with this same key combination, it dramatically improves processing time.

10970655	I'm looking to get the used css values of all DOM elements on a page. When I say "used values" I'm referring to the definition as specified in the W3C specification: 6.1.3 Used values  Computed values are processed as far as possible without formatting the document. Some values, however, can only be determined when the document is being laid out. For example, if the width of an element is set to be a certain percentage of its containing block, the width cannot be determined until the width of the containing block has been determined. The used value is the result of taking the computed value and resolving any remaining dependencies into an absolute value.These should be the final values computed with respect to the actual page layout. Mozilla's docs claim that you can use window.getComputedStyle to get the used values, but this does not make sense to me because computed values are different from used values (and I want used values). Even if these are the used values, I'm not sure if this only works in Firefox or not. Is there a way to reliably get used values in all browsers?
10970740	I believe getComputedStyle does return "used" values according to that definition. It works on all major modern browsers. Earlier versions of IE provide a near-equivalent in the form of currentStyle. Note the last sentence of the definition: The used value is the result of taking the computed value and resolving any remaining dependencies into an absolute value.(My emphasis at the end.) E.g., the "used value" is the value that is actually used.For example, this code shows me "500px" or similar, not "50%":HTML:JavaScript:Live copy | source
10973235	You could use jQuery or another preferred library in most cases.For instance, your question title has font-size:100% applied to it which can be retrieved w/firebug. But with jQuery api you can retrieve the value used like so:NB the library is included on this page, but it would be fairly trivial to create a bookmarklet that includes jQuery and polls the necessary properties.
10973315	I have a quick question regarding PHP's return statement. In C++, we're able to perform the following:Where the variable bar is assigned to foo before the result of biz() is returned.Is this possible (or something similar) in PHP? The above statement in PHP results in a parse error. Now, I'm aware that I can simply perform the assignment before the return statement, but this is just a contrived example, and I'm curious as to the feasibility. Edit: Providing a little more clarification. Here is what I'm basically attempting to do in PHP:foo is a global reference in which biz modifies. If biz returns false, the next segment in the OR statement is tested. Because biz returned false, I need to "reset" the value of foo before executing baz and so on and so forth. I'm aware that what I'm trying to do here is impure, but I'm just curious is an equivalent (or at least similar thing) is possible in PHP.
10973330	No, unfortunately PHP doesn't actually have a comma operator except in expr1 of a for loop. Everywhere else a comma is just used to separate arguments to a function or language construct.You could sort make your own comma operator user function, which just returns the last argument passed into it. Here's my shot at it:With this you could use:The following complete code outputs Hello:EditYour sample code, using the comma function, would look like this:I honestly can't recommend using this though. That is why my short answer is "No".

10982359	You can use the following code to check if the file can be opened with exclusive access (that is, it is not opened by another application). If the file isn't closed, you could wait a few moments and check again until the file is closed and you can safely copy it.You should still check if File.Copy fails, because another application may open the file between the moment you check the file and the moment you copy it.
10989718	I have following script inside my stored procedureI'm inserting some data into table (single record). First I check if it exist already, then I do some processing and insert record.Processing can take some time - let's say 2 seconds. Some times calls come in subsequently and I get constraint exceptions. Rare, but happens. I want to avoid this and at the same time I don't want to do this processing if record already exist. What is the best way to structure this code so I don't do extra work and avoid exception?This is large table with records coming in all the time. What is the best way to filter out dupes as they come in and don't spend much processing time?
10989813	One way is to perform the check and then you can always use try/catch to attempt the insert. As @MitchWheat pointed out you can eliminate this using proper transaction handling.I treated a similar topic here:

Is there a way to force the scripts to be injected again?I believe I could inject them again programmatically by removing them from the manifest and then handling which pages to inject in the background page, but this is not a good solution.I don't want to automatically refresh the user's tabs because that could lose some of their data.

10996538	This is a total newbie question. Is it possible to use the Play! framework without having to use any Scala at all? Even when I create a pure java app it seems to create the index.scala.html and uses the Scala @ syntax. Are there any samples of a pure Java app on the Play! site?I dont want to spend time learning the syntax of Scala (however much the documentation reassures me that its "just like java"). So basically i would like the app stack to be HTML,CSS,Jquery and a solid java framework on the server with a db like mongo. Thats it. If not Play! what (recent) framework could be used?
10997087	I take It you are using Play 2.You can write your entire app in Java.However the templating is done using scala. From what I understand this is a small portion of scala which you need to learn and does not require you to dive in fully into the language.Play 1 uses groovy for templating and has two other templating module (japid and rythm).Whichever framework you decide to use, it is very unlikely that you will use pure java (think jsp!)

10999643	I remember hearing somewhere that "large functions might have higher execution times" because of code size, and CPU cache or something like that.How can I tell if function size is imposing a performance hit for my application? How can I optimize against this? I have a CPU intensive computation that I have split into (as many threads as there are CPU cores). The main thread waits until all of the worker threads are finished before continuing.I happen to be using C++ on Visual Studio 2010, but I'm not sure that's really important.Edit:I'm running a ray tracer that shoots about 5,000 rays per pixel. I create (cores-1) threads (1 per extra core), split the screen into rows, and give each row to a CPU thread. I run the trace function on each thread about 5,000 times per pixel.I'm actually looking for ways to speed this up. It is possible for me to reduce the size of the main tracing function by refactoring, and I want to know if I should expect to see a performance gain.A lot of people seem to be answering the wrong question here, I'm looking for an answer to this specific question, even if you think I can probably do better by optimizing the contents of the function, I want to know if there is a function size/performance relationship.
10999697	It's not really about function size, but about what you do in it. Depending on what you do, there is possibly some way to optimize it.
10999739	It's not really the size of the function, it's the total size of the code that gets cached when it runs. You aren't going to speed things up by splitting code into a greater number of smaller functions, unless some of those functions aren't called at all in your critical code path, and hence don't need to occupy any cache. Besides, any attempt you make to split code into multiple functions might get reversed by the compiler, if it decides to inline them.So it's not really possible to say whether your current code is "imposing a performance hit". A hit compared with which of the many, many ways that you could have structured your code differently? And you can't reasonably expect changes of that kind to make any particular difference to performance.I suppose that what you're looking for is instructions that are rarely executed (your profiler will tell you which they are), but are located in the close vicinity of instructions that are executed a lot (and hence will need to be in cache a lot, and will pull in the cache line around them). If you can cluster the commonly-executed code together, you'll get more out of your instruction cache.Practically speaking though, this is not a very fruitful line of optimization. It's unlikely you'll make much difference. If nothing else, your commonly-executed code is probably quite small and adjacent already, it'll be some small number of tight loops somewhere (your profiler will tell you where). And cache lines at the lowest levels are typically small (of the order of 32 or 64 bytes), so you'd need some very fine re-arrangement of code. C++ puts a lot between you and the object code, that obstructs careful placement of instructions in memory.Tools like perf can give you information on cache misses - most of those won't be for executable code, but on most systems it really doesn't matter which cache misses you're avoiding: if you can avoid some then you'll speed your code up. Perhaps not by a lot, unless it's a lot of misses, but some.Anyway, what context did you hear this? The most common one I've heard it come up in, is the idea that function inlining is sometimes counter-productive, because sometimes the overhead of the code bloat is greater than the function call overhead avoided. I'm not sure, but profile-guided optimization might help with that, if your compiler supports it. A fairly plausible profile-guided optimization is to preferentially inline at call sites that are executed a larger number of times, leaving colder code smaller, with less overhead to load and fix up in the first place, and (hopefully) less disruptive to the instruction cache when it is pulled in. Somebody with far more knowledge of compilers than me, will have thought hard about whether that's a good profile-guided optimization, and therefore decided whether or not to implement it.
11001430	I need a program that checks if the difference between all pairs of elements is in the interval from -2 up to 2 ( &gt;= -2 &amp;&amp; &lt; 2). If it is, then return True, else return False. Foe example, [1,2,3] is True, but [1,3,4] is False.I am using the all function. What is wrong with my if clause?Or I am doing something completely wrong?
11001552	For this, it's probably easier to use list comprehensions or do-notation.pairsOf returns the list of pairs of numbers in the input lst. For example, pairsOf [1,2,3] results in [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)].Now, you can define the difference between a pair in a one-liner \(x, y) -&gt; x - y and map that over the list:Now you just have to make sure that each element in differences lst is between -2 and 2.Of course, this is just one possible way to do it. There are many other ways as well.

11009022	I have some .NET code that checks for the existence of a SQL record at a moderately-high interval. I am looking to make this check as "cheap" as possible.I'm wondering the characteristics of two queries:VSThey both produce similar execution plans. But the SELECT TOP 1 1 seems to execute faster: Less query to parse and when record is not found, it sends less down the pipe. I'm also assuming it runs faster at the client because I just need to check the Record Count, rather than marshaling the return value of IF EXISTS.Most of the performance benefits are negligible. But if both consistently return the same result, then why not choose the slightly faster method?Is "SELECT TOP 1 1" THEE best way to check for an existence of a record in .NET?(We use .NET 3.5, and I am trying to avoid LINQ because it is not used elsewhere in the application. We also have some legacy VB6 apps that we are migrating/rewriting, so they may need to execute this as well.)EDIT:Just a little more detail on design. This record is a "header". There is another table that has child records that will be read/parsed when this header is found. The lack of a record is a good thing: there is no work to do.EDIT2: The lack of a record that meets the condition will occur more often. They come in sporadic waves.

It expresses the intent of the query in a much better understood fashion than alternatives.I'd avoid COUNT(*) (as in the current answers) unless you actually need the count of rows from the table.If you want the "efficiency" of checking the rowcount from the result, I'd probably go for:Which produces the same result set as your second query (either 0 or 1 row)

11012868	Whatever is in the variable is converted to a Boolean (the variable itself of course remains intact), and then a NOT operation (!) is done on the resulting Boolean. The conversion will happen because ! is a Logical Operator and only works on Boolean values. When converting to boolean, the following values are considered FALSE:   the boolean FALSE itself the integer 0 (zero) the float 0.0 (zero) the empty string, and the string "0" an array with zero elements an object with zero member variables (PHP 4 only) the special type NULL (including unset variables) SimpleXML objects created from empty tags Tip: If the variable is not expected to be Boolean, you might want to use something more specific like isset($variable), empty($variable), $variable === '', etc. depending on what you want to check for.

11036522	I can provide more detail if necessary, but my question is basically thus:If I'm running an openfire server that encrypts traffic using an RSA pub/priv key combo that I created (and have), is there a way (preferably in Java) to sniff packets off the wire and then decrypt them using my private key? Currently I can encrypt/decrypt a string using the following:}which works fine. However, if I sniff a few packets off the wire and then try to decrypt it, I get errors. I even tried only decrypting the first 256 bytes of it, seeing as that's the limitation of my RSA key, but it still throws errors. Most notably, a BadPaddingException at the doFinal() line. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
11036567	No. With public key encryption, you can only ever decrypt with the opposite key. e.g.consider the chaos that would happen if were possible - since the public key is floating around "in the open" for everyone to see, you'd essentially be giftwrapping your data in saran wrap, because everyone would have the key to decrypt it already. This would completely torpedo the entire SSL security model.
11036812	If you are talking about SSL-protected session, then man-in-the-middle attack is possible if you have a legitimate server's private key (and can obtain the certificate which is public anyway). For practical purpose you should be able to use Wireshark to spy on your traffic. But you can't decrypt the traffic as is. Partially because it's not encrypted using public key cryptography - data is encrypted using symmetric key generated per session.

11045945	Your URL contains many unescaped % symbols and you're trying to interpolate a value into the string using the % operator. Python is looking for % characters to substitute your i into the URL. But the first likely one it sees is %A and that's not a valid format character. The error message even tells you exactly what has happened and where.Probably the easiest general solution is to use the .format() method of the string instead of the % operator:It uses different formatting placeholders that don't conflict with your URL's use of the % character.Or, in this case specifically, since you just want to append your variable to the URL, you could use straight-up concatenation:

A straightforward approach is to simply modify the code in downloaded sources and substitute your own version of a jar in the classpath.Another option is to use aspect-oriented programming techniques, likely with AspectJ to intercept and modify calls as needed.It might also be possible to hack together a solution using reflection and home-grown classloaders, but it will be painful to code.All of these are however quite risky if you don't know what you're doing. Frequently classes are made final for good reason.If you tell us more specifically what it is you're hoping to change, we might be able to provide assistance in avoiding what you currently think you need.
11081860	I have declared three variables namely in my program. Though I have clearly declared them, I keep getting an error "Use of unassigned local variable" I am completely baffled as to why my compiler is giving this error.
11081944	You should always assign default or null values when u declare vars.
11081950	Compiler is absolutely correct. Although you have declared them but Compiler did not tells you that "Use of undeclared local variable". It tells you "Use of unassigned local variable"..There is difference between declaration and assignments of variables...Assign the values to variables. In your code it should be OR

11082311	You can do that with &gt; if you want to redirect the output.For example:2&gt;&amp;1 says to redirect STDERR to the same file.This command will erase any output.txt files and creates a new one with your output. If you use &gt;&gt; it will append the output at the end of any existing output.txt file. If it doesn't exist, it will create it.
11082413	-a is only understood by the time binary (/usr/bin/time), When just using time you're using the bash built-in version which does not process the -a option, and hence tries to run it as a command.
11083552	I have created an example using JSFiddle, which you can view as a demo.The only downside is that you will need to specify column sizes as when you use position: fixed you lose the widths on the header.This is the CSS for the example, the HTML is the same as that you have supplied.

11105133	I´m trying to implement an undo (and redo) function for an editable JTable with the default components. The JTable has an extra class to specify its properties called SpecifiedJTable.To do so I wanted to grab the moment when a cell is doubleclicked (i.e. the moment when a cell is chosen/marked to be edited) to push the information in the cell and its coordinates onto the stack.This should be done by a MouseListener ...at least that was my idea.I tried this (standing in the constructor of my SpecifiedJTable class)but somehow the clickCounter doesn´t want to reach anything that´s higher than 1.I am glad about any answer and help. Thanks.
11115366	the error in the code is that the mouseClicked method is called as soon as the first click takes place. when a double click takes place the mouseClicked method is called again. you can place a static variable (or a class variable) for the earlier click event storing the time (using the e.getWhen() method).Check for the time difference and if it's small enough, execute your actions (I'd suggest calling a doubleClick method).you may have to implement mouse listener in your class JTableSpecified since a static variable might not be placed in your existing code.
11118992	The problem you are experiencing is related to use of mouseClicked() rather than using mousePressed(). In this case it appears to be very hard to increase the click counter, yet still it is possible. It took me lots of clicking and also mouse movement to increase the click counter over 1. You could try it by yourself, in your code. To get the counter over 1 you need to go crazy on the mouse by pressing &amp; releasing fast while moving the mouse from cell to cell at the same time (or maybe I was just luckily clicking between the cells?).As you can see in this fully working sample, made from your code, two mouse presses, using the mousePressed() method are being detected just fine.Conclusion: Maybe you in fact want to use the mousePressed() method?

11122702	You need to make &lt;a&gt; element floating left and &lt;span&gt; element floating right.
11122802	The reason this is happening is because the a tag has a padding, pushing down everything in it by 12px.Remove the top/bottom padding and use line-height to make it 68px tall.It might not look like it, but this does fix the problem. Remove all formatting from the span to see! But now the issue is that the text isn't aligned center within the span. You can use line-height on the span to adjust that as well.Seems to work well.DEMO

We discovered that if a person enters a 2-digit year, the year is changed to 1912 not 2012 (dates cannot be in the past). Is there a way I can:Check if they entered a 2-digit year and convert that to a 4-digit year, orGive them an error if they enter a 2-digit year.This is on an HTML form and I also am using jQuery for a bunch of other stuff.I should clarify that they enter the date as a whole date 01/01/2012 or 1/1/2012 is valid. 1/1/12 and 01/01/12 is not.

11125563	Agreed with the comment that's what SSL is for see here for a client java application that uses SSL Certificate and encryption to connect to an HTTPS/SSL site:  next you might want to have an HTTPS/SSL php server this should help:  Or use this Opensource library: If the above fails then I don't know, but a last resort would be writing your own, you may never know how secure it really is?

11130603	I have two JSON objects with the same structure that I want to visualize on my html page side-by-side. Since I'm building a comparison of sorts, I want data elements that match to be viewed on the same line. Left-only or right-only data elements need to be shown with blanks next to them in the opposite column.I'm trying to do this with JsRender/JsViews, but it is difficult to handle multiple data sources at once. Or doing each side as a separate template, each side doesn't know where to load data since it would need to know if the opposite existed.I'm up for using any other mechanism as long as it works.Thanks,Greg

11138120	Assuming you want a gradient border or what do you mean by flow?Yes it can be done.Example 2px gradient border:Simply create a div positioned relative which has a gradient background in your colorsThen create a child div positioned absolutely in there with a widht and height slightly smallerand you're ready.see
11138554	Assuming you want an animation around the box, it could be arranged by animating a sequence of lines, each animation triggering the next, as it finishes.Each line would have to be positioned at its appropriate corner.DemoA neater recursive solution could probably be built, but it's something along these lines that you'd have to go with. The border property itself cannot be animated in this manner.
11143429	I stand by my comment, but here is a basic map that implements center_changed (with a marker) and dragend with a geocoder.Here in IE9, Chrome 19 and Firefox 13 the dragend event is only fired once per drag. You'll notice that center_changed is fired many times, even while the drag isn't complete. This is why I believe your FindReverseGeocode method is being called in FixedMarkerInCenter.

11157152	My instructor basically told me that doing Selenium (acceptance) tests before implementing does not make sense, as they're told "acceptance" tests for a reason.We're doing a weird mix of Scrum and XP (for learning).Our aim was to basically formalize our specification (user stories) in these tests. Why would it be bad to have those tests before actually implementing against them?(Granted, we had to change quite a bit of the tests once we were done with implementing.)
11157157	This is duplicate of my question on SWIG mailing list.I am trying to use stl containers in my SWIG bindings. Everything works perfectly except for stl map handling in Perl. On C++ side, I haveSWIG config look like thisIn my Python script I can call TryMap this wayand get beautiful outputbut in Perl I calland get an errorI can actually do something likeand get '!', but this is not an option because there is a lot of legacy code using "TryMap" that expects normal Perl hash as its output.I believe there is a way work this out because SWIG solves this particular problem nicely in Python and even in Perl if I use stl vectors and strings but not maps.Is there any way to handle stl map with Perl in SWIG? I am using latest SWIG 2.0.7UPDATE Maybe there is something wrong with perl5/std_map.i. It is too short =)

11157445	If you are developing acceptance tests before you write your code you can specifiy what you expect the application to do in advance. This is the Test-driven development cycle: write a failing test, make the test pass, refactor. As well as you can do the cycle with Unit-tests you should also do the same with acceptance and integration tests if you are developing test-driven.There is a nice book about TDD and how to write acceptance tests:

Packet more than MTU would be fragmented and has to be defragmented at the final host, there are also chances the fragments gets fragmented again on the path and which again can add the delay. sometimes if some N/W element is configured for layer 4 filtering then it defragments(not the final host) apply rules and then again frgaments and forward. Thats the reason the applicaiton which need performance always try to send data with size &lt;= (MTU-ETHHDR-IPHDR)

11166445	I've never come across a source-code level (performance) optimizer for Java. Indeed, apart from pointing out obvious beginner mistakes (e.g. calling new String(...) all over the place), I don't think this is a tractable problem.Non-trivial optimization requires the entity doing the optimization to understand what the code is doing (from a functional standpoint) and how it works in practice, in the context of the entire application and all likely input sets. That's really an AI problem ... and it is way beyond the current "state of the art".(By the way, I'd be really like to be wrong on this. If practical source-code optimizers capable of doing non-trivial optimizations without direction do exist, it would be major progress!)
11166549	Your problem is that you do not have a form tag - so the browser won't submit anything back to your server by default.The way to get the browser to submit the form to your server is simply to wrap your inputs (both text and submit) in a &lt;form&gt; tag with an action attribute pointing at the URL where you will be accepting the response.So your code would look like this (wrapping code left out):You could use method="get" rather than method="post" if you wanted, but POST is generally what you are looking for. You will then set up your app to handle post requests at your endpoint:If you want to be able to send the value back asynchronously to the server (so the entire page doesn't reload) then you can use Ajax to submit just the value to the server. Your page will look the same - simply use JavaScript to prevent the form's submission and then submit an XHR request back to the server using the POST method. (If this is all very confusing you may want to consider choosing a library to help abstract away some of the differences between browsers for you - jQuery is popular these days ... if a tad bit over-recommended.)

If not, I want an error message to be displayed, and for the script to exit without running any other function in the controller. This controller will only be called by ajax so the error would be displayed via JSON and then the javascript on the client will display it to the user.How can I do this? If I did this:I don't think the message would be displayed because codeigniter uses output buffering. Any ideas?

11185079	I would like to create workflow using SDL Tridion 2011 SP1, and i am going through the documentation in the live content portal.I have few questions when I go through the documentation as follows:Can I use C# (TOM.NET) for automatted activities/decisions? or should I use only VBScript (TOM)? Is there any sample code given in the live content portal for automatted activity/decision?If C# (TOM.NET) is not allowed to use in workflows, why are its namespace/class/member references given there in TOM.NET API file?If VBScript only allowed to use in WF, where can I get code/TOM API reference in SDL live content? As of now I dont have access to SDL Tridion server to get the documentation from the installer package.
11185693	I think you should use flashdata and redirect to a controller with it. Then you can control if any flashdata comes in session, after that write it in view.
11188010	Can I use C# (TOM.NET) for automated activities? Or should I use only VBScript (TOM)?You can use the TOM within your C# code to write automated activities. There is a primary interop assembly provided for that purpose (IIRC).Is use of TOM.NET allowed in workflows?Accessing workflow items from within existing TOM.NET code (i.e. a TBB or DataExtender) is supported. So you can query items that are in workflow, kick off workflows, etc.. But using the TOM.NET for writing automated workflow activities is not supported. The reason for this has something to do with incompatible threading models from what I recall. But I mostly just took the word of the developers for it; they are bound to know better than me.Where can I get code/TOM API reference?API reference documentation for Tridion is not in LiveContent, but instead is delivered in CHM (or zipped JavaDoc) files. The latest documentation for the TOM API can be found in the "SDL Tridion 2009 full documentation" zip on the Tridion 2009 documentation page on SDL Tridion World (login required).Thanks to Quirijn and Alvin for pointing this out in the comments.

11195422	Yes but with php tags &lt;?php ?&gt; (so that php knows its code):It is possible because PHP (server-side) runs before jQuery (client-side). The page first goes to server and server returns the response (php code is parsed there) to the browser.
11195529	For simple variables, just do as the users said.F.ex. var jquery_string = "&lt;?php echo $string_php;?&gt;"; (taken from @Blaster's solution).In other words: The most simple solution is to output a php variable that we intend to use as string literal via echo anywhere we define the variable.But: a correct approach would be that everytime we use a serverside variable as a Javascript string, it should be encoded, because the above solutions would fail when double quotes are present. Here json_encode may come handy.Code exampleWe want Javascript alert the string "Hey", dude!results in:Instead:results in:

11195686	It is fine to use the TOM .Net API. However we must consider that we would need to create Session instances since our new TOM .Net for Workflow won't allow you to pass a WorkItem instance from VBScript (Code Tab in Visio for Automatic Activities) and you are forced to pass the TcmUri for that WorkItem. The session creation is mandatory in order to get Tridion objects instantiated since you just have a tcmuri. The recommendation here is to use the C# class registered as a COM class by using the ComVisible and ProgId attributes but use the CoreServices for all the processing in your Com Visible class.If you use the Core Services for processing you won't need to take care of sessions creations and your core would be much faster and scalable. You might be interested in use a TCP binding or a Net Pipes binding for performance obviously.
11195735	You can use following nested SQL:
11195781	Here some considerations.1) Use Marshal.ReleaseComObject to release the Tridion COM Objects but not just once call it until the references counter reaches 0.2) Don't pass COM Objects as parameters in functions.3) Don't declare or avoid as much as you can to declare COM objects as fields in your class.4) Consider using WeakReferences. A weak reference will mark your object immediately as ready for GC. Since the .Net GC runs in a background thread and we don't know exactly when it will be executed always add a null checking in all your weak references to make sure that your objects are still alive before you use it, in case it is already collected you will need to instantiate the weak reference again.
11207574	I have a "tasks" table with a priority column, which has a unique constraint.I'm trying to swap the priority value of two rows, but I keep violating the constraint. I saw this statement somewhere in a similar situation, but it wasn't with MySQL.This will lead to the error:Is it possible to accomplish this in MySQL without using bogus values and multiple queries?EDIT:Here's the table structure:
11207946	Is it possible to accomplish this in MySQL without using bogus values and multiple queries?No. (none that I can think of).The problem is how MySQL processes updates. MySQL (in difference with other DBMS that implement UPDATE properly), processes updates in a broken manner. It enforces checking of UNIQUE (and other) constraints after every single row update and not - as it should be doing - after the whole UPDATE statement completes. That's why you don't have this issue with (most) other DBMS.For some updates (like increasing all or some ids, id=id+1), this can be solved by using - another non-standard feature - an ORDER BY in the update.For swapping the values from two rows, that trick can't help. You'll have to use NULL or a bogus value (that doesn't exist but is allowed in your column) and 2 or 3 statements.You could also temporarily remove the unique constraint but I don't think that's a good idea really.So, if the unique column is a signed integer and there are no negative values, you can use 2 statements wrapped up in a transaction:
11208842	you can achieve swapping your values with your above mentioned update statement, with a slight change in your key indexes.This will have a primary key index as a combination of id and priority. you cna then swap values. I dont see any need of user variables or temp variables here. Hope this solves your issue :)

11240178	I've recently been looking through my warnings in Eclipse and come across this one:It will give a compiler warning if the method can be declared as static.[edit] Exact quote within the Eclipse help, with stress on private and final: When enabled, the compiler will issue an error or a warning for methods which are private or final and which refer only to static members.Yes I know I can turn it off, but I want to know the reason for turning it on?Why would it be a good thing to declare every method possible as static?Will this give any performance benefits? (in a mobile domain)Pointing out a method as static, I suppose is showing that you don't use any instance variables therefore could be moved to a utils style class?At the end of the day should I just turn this off 'ignore' or should I fix the 100+ warnings it has given me?Do you think this is just extra keywords that dirty the code, as the compiler will just inlines these methods anyway? (kind of like you don't declare every variable you can final but you could).
11240227	Whenever you write a method, you fulfill a contract in a given scope. The narrower the scope is, the smaller the chance is that you write a bug.When a method is static, you can't access non-static members; hence, your scope is narrower. So, if you don't need and will never need (even in subclasses) non-static members to fulfill your contract, why give access to these fields to your method? Declaring the method static in this case will let the compiler check that you don't use members that you do not intend to use.And moreover, it will help people reading your code understand the nature of the contract.That's why it's considered good to declare a method static when it's actually implementing a static contract.Edit from comments: (tx owlstead)In some cases, your method only means something relative to an instance of your class, and it happens that its implementation doesn't actually use any non-static field or instance. In such cases, you would not mark the method static.Examples of where you would not use the static keyword: An extension hook which does nothing (but could do something with instance data in a subclass)A very simple default behavior meant to be customisable in a subclass.Event handler implementation: implementation will vary with the class of the event handler but will not use any property of the event handler instance.
11240286	The methods you can declare as static are the ones that don't require instantiation, such as Which you can then in return call out in any other class without instanciating that class.... But that's something you probably already know. It doesn't give you any real benefits per se, other than making it more clear that the method doesn't use any instance variables.In other words, you can most safely just turn it off completely.

11240302	As you've discovered, the first one makes the page not work in some circumstances, and is - for this, and other reasons - generally considered bad practice. Use the second.
11240491	The first example:...will do two things:Its onclick will submit the first form in the document (i.e., the one specified by the 0 index in forms[0]).It will submit the form it is in (if it is in a form) because a button with no type attribute specified will be a submit button by default.This two-step double-submit behaviour can be seen in this quick-and-dirty demo:  (and is likely to lead to weird behaviour that might be a bit confusing to debug). If the button isn't actually in a form then this won't be a problem.The second example:Will simply submit the form it is in (if it is in one).In my opinion the second option is definitely preferable for several reasons, including but not limited to:It will work even if the user has JS disabled.It doesn't hard-code a form index with forms[0].It is shorter and clearer.It won't clash with other form submit validation.

11245179	Omniture is an analytics tool, in a sense it's comparable to google analytics. What you're seeing is probably logging of Omniture javascript code on a website you're viewing.EDIT:To elaborate. What comes up in the Web Console logs is basically anything that calls console.log() in a webpage that you're viewing.

Called this way, the function is just that - a function. You need to call this.onS(object), but this won't work in your case because the onSuccess function does not know about this either.To call the foo/onS function with the outermost object as this you must save a reference to it in another variable, commonly called that:

11321364	Writing data from most STL containers cannot be done with outfile.write((const char*)&amp;(ve[0]), ve.size()); because they manage their memory in complex ways that's fundamental to the way they operate. With vector, it works, because memory storage is contiguous, but vector&lt;bool&gt; is special because of the way it packs multiple bools into a single byte. As commenters have already pointed out, ve[0] returns a special temporary quasi-reference type, and writing that reference out by casting to a char* will produce something totally unrelated to the data that's in the vector.Even if this construction gave you access to the raw memory of the vector, the code that you're using to write out the data is incompatible with the code that you're using to read in the data. The code that you're using to write out the data would pack 8 bool entries into each char, but the code you're using to read in the data converts each char into a single bool.Since you're reading back your data using an istreambuf_iterator, why not write it out the same way:This writes out one bool per byte.If you want to write out data in a packed representation that writes one bit per bool, I think you'll need to invent your own input and output iterators.
11323346	I am using Eclipse and I also had to change the Text file encoding in:->Windows->Preferences->Workspace Then it worked fine.Thanks
11324018	I do hope that this is not deleted as subjective. The only subjective part might be that 1) my Delphi is better than my PHP and 2) I prefer compiled to interpreted programming languages.However, the actual (non-subjective) question is - if I choose Delphi and use a TWebBrowser (or similar mechanism) to view/manipulate Google Earth, will I be restricting my available functionality in any way?Are there some things that I can only do "in a browser" that I can't do "in a VCL browser component"?[Update] I forgot to say that 1) I am comfortable with Windows only and, 2) the Google Earth functionality is only one part of a larger APP (for me, it is easier to implement that app as a Delphi program than something browser based, but that sounds subjective again, which is why I never mentioned it. I'll just stick with "if I choose Delphi and use a TWebBrowser will I be restricting my available functionality in any way?" as the question, since that can be answered.
11324652	What's the real question? As it stands, this can't be answered... The correct answer is neither "Yes" nor "No... "Yes, there's a technical reason not to use TWebBrowser... It might have weird issues on some obscure operating system...", or "No, there is no technical reason not to use a TWebBrowser, it's there and does what you want (whatever that may be)".That said, if you only care about google-maps... Why not use Google Chrome or any other browser you may happen to already have installed? Don't use Delphi in order to use it, question your requirements and use the tools that suit. Sometimes, you can just use an existing browser, no coding required!!
11324785	There is no technical reason why not to use the TWebBrowser to display maps, or anything for that matter. In fact, this is a matter of opinion, and most likely you have heard people's opinions telling you not to do so. Unfortunately, Stack Overflow is a Question/Answer site, so a question like this isn't necessarily feasible.The TWebBrowser wraps an Internet Explorer browser window, and relies on whatever version of IE is installed. Anything which you can open in Internet Explorer can also be opened in the TWebBrowser, Google Earth included. It's a matter of pointing it to a page and loading it. As for technical reasons, there may be some glitches here and there, but I don't see why not.
11324878	My scroll has some views that is cornerRadius = 10.0 and masksToBounds = YES.This causes a performance issue for scrolling my scroll view. Though I tried each view's shouldRasterize is set YES, the issue is not solved.However, I know the solution for this issue. That is what masksToBound is set NO. (masksToBound's default value is NO)Although masksToBound is NO, my views's corners still have curve and the performance issue is solved, too.I want to know about relation between cornerRadius and masksToBounds. I'm afraid of unexpected issues with this setting.Thank you.
11325012	There is not any specific relation ship .. actually when you call the Corner Radius it will crop the view at what radius you have passed and MaskToBound:Yes make it transparent to that part which you have cropped else it would be visible...
11325605	After providing cornerRadius which specifies a radius used to draw the rounded corners of the receiver’s backgroundNow it depends on masksToBounds which determines if the sublayers are clipped to the receiver’s bounds. So If YES, an implicit mask matching the layer bounds is applied to the layer, including the effects of the cornerRadius property. If YES and a mask property is specified, the two masks are multiplied to get the actual mask values.For example:if you set that on a CALayer with image contents, the image will still be drawn outside the corner radius boundary. You can solve this by setting sublayer.masksToBounds to YES, but if you do that the shadows won’t show up because they’ll be masked out!EDIT : Just formatted to catch eye in answer.

11348229	How to parse the xml file? I am new to XML, I tried this, but it seems to be not working :
11348458	The problem is that the sitemapindex element defines a default namespace. You need to specify the namespace when you select the nodes, otherwise it will not find them. For instance:Normally speaking, when using the XmlNameSpaceManager, you could leave the prefix as an empty string to specify that you want that namespace to be the default namespace. So you would think you'd be able to do something like this:However, if you try that code, you'll find that it won't find any matching nodes. The reason for this is that in XPath 1.0 (which is what XmlDocument implements), when no namespace is provided, it always uses the null namespace, not the default namespace. So, it doesn't matter if you specify a default namespace in the XmlNamespaceManager, it's not going to be used by XPath, anyway. To quote the relevant paragraph from the Official XPath Specification: A QName in the node test is expanded into an expanded-name using the namespace declarations from the expression context. This is the same way expansion is done for element type names in start and end-tags except that the default namespace declared with xmlns is not used: if the QName does not have a prefix, then the namespace URI is null (this is the same way attribute names are expanded). It is an error if the QName has a prefix for which there is no namespace declaration in the expression context.Therefore, when the elements you are reading belong to a namespace, you can't avoid putting the namespace prefix in your XPath statements. However, if you don't want to bother putting the namespace URI in your code, you can just use the XmlDocument object to return the URI of the root element, which in this case, is what you want. For instance:
11348476	I would definitely use LINQ to XML instead of the older XmlDocument based XML API. You can accomplish what you are looking to do using the following code. Notice, I changed the name of the element that I am trying to get the value of to 'loc' and 'lastmod', because this is what is in your sample XML ('name' and 'url' did not exist):
11352056	In MySQL, when I create a composite primary key, say with columns X, Y, Z, then all three columns become indexes automatically. Does the same happen for Postgres?
11352281	Yes: PostgreSQL automatically creates a unique index when a unique constraint or primary key is defined for a table. The index covers the columns that make up the primary key or unique constraint (a multicolumn index, if appropriate), and is the mechanism that enforces the constraint.
11352543	If you create a composite primary key, on (x, y, z), PostgreSQL implements this with the help of one UNIQUE multi-column index on (x, y, z). In addition, all three columns have to be NOT NULL, of course, which is the main difference between a PRIMARY KEY and a UNIQUE INDEX.Besides the obvious restrictions on your data, the multi-column index also has a somewhat different effect on the performance of queries than three individual indexes on x, y and z.We had a very thorough discussion about that recently on dba.SE in this related question. With examples, benchmarks, discussion and outlook to the upcoming feature of index-only scans in version 9.2.In particular, a primary key on (x, y, z) will speed up queries with conditions on x, (x,y) or (x,y,z) optimally. It will also help with queries on y, z, (y,z) or (x,z) but to a far lesser extent.If you need to speed up queries on the latter combinations, you may want to create one or more additional indexes.
11365297	According to MSDN, @@IDENTITY returns the last identity value generated for any table in the current session, across all scopes.Has anyone come across a situation where this functionality was useful? I can't think of a situation when you would want the last ID generated for any table across all scopes or how you would use it.UPDATE:Not sure what all the downvotes are about, but I figured I'd try to clarify what I'm asking.First off I know when to use SCOPE_IDENTITY and IDENT_CURRENT. What I'm wondering is when would it be better to use @@IDENTITY as opposed to these other options? I have yet to find a place to use it in my day to day work and I'm wondering if someone can describe a situation when it is the best option.Most of the time when I see it, it is because someone doesn't understand what they were doing, but I assume Microsoft included it for a reason.
11365373	@@IDENTITY is fantastic for identifying individual rows based on an ID column.In this case the ID column would be reliant on the @@IDENTITY property.
11365461	In general, it shouldn't be used. SCOPE_IDENTITY() is far safer to use (as long as we're talking about single-row inserts, as highlighted in a comment above), except in the following scenario, where @@IDENTITY is one approach that can be used (SCOPE_IDENTITY() cannot in this case):your code knowingly fires a triggerthe trigger inserts into a table with an identity columnthe calling code needs the identity value generated inside the triggerthe calling code can guarantee that the @@IDENTITY value generated within the trigger will never be changed to reflect a different table (e.g. someone adds logging to the trigger after the insert you were relying on)This is an odd use case, but feasible.Keep in mind this won't work if you are inserting multiple rows and need multiple IDENTITY values back. There are other ways, but they also require the option to allow result sets from cursors, and IIRC this option is being deprecated.

11381976	I am getting information from a database that I have no control over. The value of "state" is a user entered (and properly cleaned) value, but may be the written out state name or the two letter postal abbreviation. I can easily build an associative array of states and abbreviations. But I was wondering if there is a way, PHP, to determine if a value is in the array of states/abbrev as a key OR a value. So, if you enter "CA" it sees it is a valid two letter key and returns it. If it sees "XY" is NOT a valid key then it retuns a default "OTHER" key (ZZ), but if the user entered input is "New York" it will see it is a valid value and return the associated key, "NY"?

11427442	Since you are using SqlConnection, it does not support Decr Pool Size or Incr Pool Size. This property is supported with OracleConnectionYou may check this article: Connection Pooling in DotNetFrom the article:  You should refer to the documentation if you're using a .NET Data Provider other than SQL Server.

11429413	Php is always interpreted before sending content to client. HTML is part of that content. Once you get to see HTML elements, such as your dropdown list, you can't tell PHP to modify an exisiting variable.The best thing to do is to use a form whichs sends GET or POST data to a php page.
11429435	This can't be done with purely HTML/PHP.You could trigger a form post when the users selects another option, or, better yet, do an AJAX call to set the variable.But why would you want to do it real time?Just get the value when the form is submitted in the $_POST['nameofyoucontrol'] variable.

Why is the .NET output so much larger?Actually it turns out that while the result from PHP and Fiddler are the same length that they are not the same. I can decompress the PHP version in .NET, but not the Fiddler version. The PHP page decompresses all three, so it looks like there may be an incompatibility between Fiddler's and .NET's implementations of gzip. As requested I've uploaded the three outputs to dropbox here.And these are the raw hexdumps of those files (not sure if they are really any use like this, but I think it shows that the difference between the fiddler and PHP version is in the header, rather than the compressed data itself):Fiddler:PHP:C#:

11435898	Preface: .NET users should not use the Microsoft-provided GZipStream or DeflateStream classes under any circumstances, unless Microsoft replaces them completely with something that works. Use the DotNetZip library instead.Update to Preface: The .NET Framework 4.5 and later have fixed the compression problem, and GZipStream and DeflateStream use zlib in those versions. I do not know if the CRC problem referenced below has been fixed.Another update: The CRC problem is not only not fixed, but Microsoft has decided that they won't fix it!This is one of several bugs in GZipStream. No self-respecting gzip compressor should ever produce 133 bytes of output from 11 bytes of input. See my comments at Why does BCL GZipStream (with StreamReader) not reliably detect Data Errors with CRC32? .What is happening internally is that GZipStream is not using the static or stored methods, both of which would produce compressed data about the same size as the input data (on top of which would be added 18 bytes of gzip header and trailer). Instead it is using the dynamic method, which creates a very large code descriptor header for a very small number of codes. It is simply a bug / very bad implementation.Update:With the hex dumps, I can provide some analysis. First, both the Fiddler and php output are correct and proper. The only difference between them is in the gzip header, in particular the timestamp set in Fiddler but not in php, and the originating operating system set in php but not in Fiddler. For both the 13 bytes of compressed data is identical, and can be represented as (using my infgen program to disassemble deflate streams):which is exactly as it should be. A single static block, which requires no code descriptors, and simply coding all of the bytes as literals. (No matches of previous strings with lengths and distances.)The output of GZipStream on the other hand is a horrible mess in several ways. The compressed data is:So what is all that? The actual data is just the line near the end "literal 'Hello World", which just codes each byte of the input. What precedes it is a description of a set of Huffman codes for literals, lengths, and distances. Here are the things wrong with it:First off, it should not be using dynamic at all. Describing the set of codes takes about 100 bytes. This is precisely why the deflate format provides a pre-defined set of codes used in static blocks. The compressor should select a static block in this case (which is what php and Fiddler are doing).Second, every single possible code is defined, even though the vast majority are never used! When using a dynamic block, a proper compressor will only define codes for literals, lengths, and distances actually used in that block. In this case there are no lengths or distances used, and only eight different literals used (H, e, l, o, space, w, r, and d). Instead it proceeds to define 256 literal codes, 29 length codes, and 30 distance codes. I am guessing that some experimentation will show that the dynamic header from GZipStream is always the same, in which case it's not even dynamic, which is the whole point!Third, it throws in an unnecessary empty stored block at the end. The first block should have been marked as the last block.All of this points to the simple fact that whoever wrote this GZipStream code was, to put it as politely as I can, lacking in any understanding of the deflate format or compression in general. They elected to produce only dynamic blocks (except for an empty static block at the end), to only produce the same dynamic header every time (I think), defeating the purpose of dynamic blocks, and to not bother to figure out if the current block is last one, requiring putting out an empty block to mark the end.As noted elsewhere, those aren't the only problems with GZipStream. It can't even properly use the CRC-32 as intended to detect corrupt streams.The truly perplexing thing is not why Microsoft assigned someone incompetent to write a gzip compressor and decompressor, but rather why they assigned anyone at all to write it! There is freely available code, zlib, that has an extremely liberal license that permits commercial use with no attribution. This code has been deployed widely for almost two decades, and does all the things it's supposed to do correctly and efficiently. Most everything else uses zlib, including php and I suspect Fiddler as well.

BIRT may not be as powerful as JasperReports, but it can achieve most of the common needs.BIRT designer generates a .rptdesign file similar to JRXML in JasperReports.About your question: almost everything is possible to achieve programmatically in BIRT. BIRT Report Engine APIs is the best source for you to get started with all the functionalities you have mentioned. It has good examples given for every functionality.Not sure. BIRT usually fetches pre-saved data from DB and generates the report. You could though see the real time data representation (in the form of a flash chart may be) with the help of some external libraries (See if this thread and this example helps). But I am not aware of a direct way of converting the real time data to PDF/HTML report. You will have to find some hack(s).Yes of course. Refer the APIs. To be specific, irendertask.Sources to get more information/answers:There are several example reports given on the website. A quick glance through them might give you more insights.For discussions and troubleshooting, refer eclipse community forum and BIRTExchange (heavily used by BIRT users).BIRT: A Field Guide to Reporting is an excellent book.

11454143	From the manuals, I draw that when a php session var is set, it is written to a text file in the session_save_path folder. I am just curious to find out if this happens as soon as the interpreter hits the line with the session variable or does it ( writing to the text file ) takes place when the PHP interpreter exits processing the file?For example, if I were to set and update a session variable in two consecutive lines, (as in the example I gave below), does the PHP interpreter saves the files twice back to back? In other words, which code snippets has the right commenting?
11454425	Sessions will be written in cookies or whatever storage you choose only after flushing the setter page. ex:  having pageA and pageB :   setting in pageA :  session["foo"] = "bar";  session["foo"] will be available to pageB only after:  leaving pageA to pageB or leaving pageA and refreshing pageBthat considered, the best definition IMHO is the second one.Happy coding!
11454452	Data is written to file if:session_write_close() is calledthe script execution is finishedSo provided that you don't do 1), your second assumption is correct.Writing to the file every time a variable changes would be VERY expensive, because generally speaking accessing and writing to the disk is slow, hence why PHP won't do that. It should be noted however that caching systems such as memcache or redis will store changes as they happen, so it can be a good idea to rely on them when PHP sessions do not suffice in terms of reliability.

11459975	I have a number of classes, please allow me to introduce them and then ask my question at the end:I have a container class which contains two objects in a composite relationship:A and B are superclasses (or Interfaces), with subtypes that can also be the type held in the composite relationship.A contains a member of (interface) type C:My problem is that I wish to modify the state of object b from a method starting in the container class, which eventually calls code down the hierarchy, to classes D and E- calling myMethod() via dynamic binding. I want to do this because I am going to use polymorphism to run the correct myMethod() (depending on whether the type of object is D or E) and I wish to do this, rather than write IF statements.So my problem is that it seems very bad continually passing the instance of object b down the class hierarchy to myMethod, so that I can run b-specific code to modify the state of b. Is there anything else I can do to modify b from d and e (collectively known as c)?I can get this to work using just interfaces but without using generics- but when I added generics i had problems with types and that made me start to think if my whole design was flawed? EDIT: I could probably do this easily just by using IF statements- but I wanted an elegant solution using polymorphism of classes D and E.
11460034	I think(I'm not sure, as I am not good at java) that if you set them to final it doesn't go down the hierarchy, I mean, you can still declare a variale with the same name.
11460219	First of all, if I understood your question correctly, no instance of B is being "passed down" in your code. Dynamic dispatch will simply cause the myMethod() implementation in the actual type of a to be called with an instance of B as argument.While it may be tedious to have to write the argument explicitly every time you implement myMethod(), there's nothing wrong with it.The alternative is to give each subclass/implementation of A an attribute of type B. In this case, however, you would have to pass your B instance down the chain of constructors to the class that actually has your B attribute. Your code would become:And then somewhere, e.g. in Container's constructor:

11478067	This has been asked before by other people, but I've never seen an adequate answer. Is there a valid replacement to the &lt;center&gt; tag? I know there's margin: 0 auto;, but that requires setting a width. There's also align="center", but I believe that that's invalid code as well. Is there something as simple as &lt;center&gt; that's valid? There are rare occasions where I still end up using it, even though it is deprecated. Just today, I ended up using a &lt;center&gt; to center the one button that needed centered on a web page. Yes, I could have set the width and gave it margin: 0 auto, but that's a lot of work for centering one single element, and it dirties up my code, which I take pride in keeping orderly. I don't really understand why &lt;center&gt; was deprecated in the first place, if nothing has replaced it.Thanks!

11483556	You can't add programmatically to the Routes object, but you can intercept web requests and handle them yourself by overriding GlobalSettings.onRouteRequest.

11501154	This is just a matrix transpose operation. And there is even a problem and solution for in-place matrix transposition on Wikipedia.No extra space is impossible, since you need to at least go through the array. O(1) additional memory is possible, with heavy penalty on the time complexity.The solution is built on follow-the-cycle algorithm in the Wikipedia page: for each cell, we will find the cell with the smallest index in the cycle. If the cell with the smallest index is greater than or equal (>=) to the index of the current cell, we will perform chain swapping. Otherwise, we ignore the cell, since it has been swapped correctly. The (loosely analyzed) upper bound on time complexity can go as high as O((MN)2) (we go through M * N cells, and the cycle can only be as long as the total number of cells).

11522946	A restful api has to use either get, post, put or delete request methods. The behavaiour and data submitted is entirely determined by the uri string. No query paramters or post variables.Is this true ?Valid : http://example.com/foo/84Not valid : http://example.com/foo/?value=84Valid : Not valid :editTwo answers so far, and the contradict each other.
11523006	POST variables are definitely OK otherwise how would you submit a new resource or update it?GET parameters are fine to specify how the resource should be rendered. So indeed http://example.com/foo/?value=84 is not right - the URL doesn't represent a resource.However, http://example.com/user/84?fields=first_name,last_name would be ok. In that case, you would use the additional query parameters to specify that you only want the first name and last name for that resource.
11523160	Saying that http://example.com/foo/?value=84 is not valid is not entireley true. What i mean is that as long that it is a valid URL it will work and you'll be able to get the parameters via get or post.On the other hand, REST is an architecture and one of its demands is a clean URL (one that does not include params with a '?') so such a url is not considered a REST like URL. So if you intend to build a REST based application, you should only use clean urls. EDIT:I see from the comments below you have a problem understanding what is REST so i'll try to give a simple example:In order to get data you will probably use http://example.com/foo/84 as a get request and the rest FW knows to get resource foo with id 84.In order to post data about foo, you might call: http://example.com/foo/84 as a POST request and now the Rest FW know that since its a post request it will call the method responsible for handling post and not the one for handling getTo delete, you call the same URL with DELETE action and i think you know the rest.So, although you have the same URL it really matters if its a GET/POST/PUT/DELETE request.

11544026	Should besecond parameter is for the index for indexed properties.Not sure what watch is doing, I must admit.
11544184	Obviously, there is no GetValue method that only takes one argument as parameter in .Net 4 for the PropertyInfo class The only possibility I can see right now for the watch window to return something, is that somewhere in your code your have a GetValue extension method for the PropertyInfo type that only needs one parameter as input. It could be unknown in your code because no using [PropertyInfoExtensionNamespace] is specified. Maybe for an unknown (or buggy) reason, it's known for the debugger.See this blog post for a discussion about extension methods + debugger buggy behaviors.
11544311	I've got a table of addresses that I'm replicating. There are 14 different types of addresses available. In order to cut down on the replicated data, I'm filtering on the AddressType field.

However, a recent change requires I have both AddressType 1 and 2 replicated. I at first changed the filter to Would I be better off with a filter of Thoughts?
11544461	There can be a significant difference as the numbers get larger. You won't see a performance difference at the smaller numbers but you will see a difference as it gets larger, especially if there is an index on AddressType. Your IN () version essentially gets translated to:I do agree with the others for this specific case. (1) the performance difference when there are only 14 values is unlikely to be noticeable. (2) Jonathan's point that IN () more accurately reflects what you want to do is a good one, also.But for future readers who maybe have a lot more possible values, I think it's important to note how things can change when the list is not so limited (or when &lt; and IN () no longer offer the same functionality, e.g. when an address type changes). At larger sizes even when there is the convenience that everything in the IN () list matches a range criterion, there are still other things to consider: (1) it is less convenient to type IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, ...) and this also can lead to a much larger batch size when we're talking about extremes.

Your query is fine wrt NULLS as written but: IF nulls are possible... and IF you decide to change or reuse the SQL ad hoc to say, Negate it...you might have an issue with the comparison as opposed to IN.for instance how would NOT IN (1,2) perform vs >= 3 ... or whatever incarnations we might use. A NULL is TRUE in the first but FALSE in the second. (NULLS is comparisons).Considering NULLS should be like breathing in SQL creation.
11557523	Setting the workbook encoding to 'latin-1' seems to have achieved the same: (It was set at 'UTF-8' before)The other answer didn't work in my case as there were other fields that were not strings.
11558022	I have a WPF MVVM data form window with data validation. A lot of the controls are text boxes. Currently, the data binding trigger is set to the default, i. e. loss of focus. This means that a field is only validated when it is likely to be filled out completely. So when deleting a number and typing another number, the transient empty value will not be displayed as input error.But a drawback is that the Save button can only be enabled when the focus moves out of the text box. (No matter where, just out of the edited control. Assuming there is anything else focusable.) If this is the only change, the user waits for the Save button to be available and nothing happens. For the Save button, I'd like to use an immediate binding trigger. How can that be done?Edit: Forgot to mention that my Save button (which uses ICommand) is only enabled when the input is determined modified and valid. So the data will remain unmodified until data binding updates it, and that won't happen until the focus moves to another control.
11558161	Set your Binding's UpdateSourceTrigger property to PropertyChanged. The default for TextBoxes is LostFocus.Update: So you want to have data binding working on your TextBox and only allow numbers? Have a look at this question: Create WPF TextBox that accepts only numbersOr use a converter and bind the Save button's IsEnabled property to your TextBox (maybe using a MultiBinding if there's more than one), and use a converter which determines if the text is a valid number and returns true or false.
11559351	if if have an object (in my case TJSONData) and I want to free this object the programm flow sometimes hangs at this position. I already have a construct like the following in my code but it seems to not fit the case some times:I can reproduce this behavior in tests if I try to free an object two times. In my program this should normally not happen but now my real question:Is there a way to check if the object is already free? Or do I need to use also FreeAndNil();?
11559525	The Assigned function checks to see if a reference is not nil. It returns True if not nil, and False if nil.Obviously when you free the object and do not set reference to nil it will pass on next Assigned check (reference &lt;> nil) and will be attempted to free again. But the reference (pointer) is already dangling (pointing to freed or worse, changed, memory).Generally you should set your references to nil or better - use FreeAndNil function. This way each time you will want to access the freed object it will be nil and thats your check.
11560209	There was a large thread in Delphi forum (the tread that eventually crushed the forum) about FreeAndNil.Common point was that for 95% of tasks you should not check if an object is alive, you should know it beforehand and architect the program so that you always know and never need those checks.Some survived or revived links are at  and at https://forums.embarcadero.com/message.jspa?messageID=413796
11561978	I actually had a similar question a while back and the solution I ended using was a custom DependencyProperty that kicked off a timer when a key was pressed, and only actually processed the PropertyChange notification if a specific time had passed.This means the bound property doesn't get updated (and validated) unless the user pauses in typing for a set period of times.The code can be found here (may need a bit of cleanup), and it is used like this:Edit: Actually this link might be better. It's a markup extension so you can use it directly from your binding. I can't remember which of these two methods I used in the past, but I know it was one of them :)

11573077	I have faced the problem with the connection limited in WCF. My WCF service was hosted in IIS and my windows form application client connects to WCF. In the Windows_Closed event, I call the client.Close() method to notify the WCF service that "I quit" but in cases of my client crashed, the connection between my client and WCF service still exists for a time, I simulated 10 crashed time then my app did not work anymore.And the question is, how to release the connection between WCF and crashed client? because the maxConnections of the server is limited and equal to 10 for example.Thanks you!
11573160	You can make use of using code block in your client:This isn't really reliable so you may want to go for try-catch-finally instead. Make sure that client.Abort is called in each of the catch blocks.
11573685	You could use the InactivityTimeout as Brijesh points out if you are using ReliableSession. Otherwise you should leverage the basic WCF timeouts.See Timeouts WCF Services for a description of how each timeout is implemented.Timeouts are often an annoyance for developers, but this is precisely the purpose for which they exist.
11579089	I have a web service; let's say that this web service does many calculations, it consumes a lot of memory resources. If my web services is call by 2 different clients, then the server will consume twice the resources. is it possible to limit my service to being used by one client, but not by using user authentication?One idea that I have is to know when the service is being consumed, so if another user wants to use the service, it will receive a message that the service is been used by another user.I know that one of the major goals of web services is to allow many users, and limiting the concurrent users is not a good idea. I am just curious if it is possible and how to do it, where can i find the documentation so i can learn the process.
11579521	You should use a mutex :The first parameter in the mutex call means that the mutex is initially owned by the thread, "Global" means that there can be only one mutex with this name on the computer runnig the webservice and finally for additional info :

11584711	I need to circularly shift individual columns of a matrix. This is easy if you want to shift all the columns by the same amount, however, in my case I need to shift them all by a different amount.Currently I'm using a loop and if possible I'd like to remove the loop and use a faster, vector based, approach.My current codeIs is possible to remove the loop from this code?Update I tested all three methods and compared them to the loop described in this question. I timed how long it would take to execute a column by column circular shift on a 1000x1000 matrix 100 times. I repeated this test several times.Results:My loop took more than 12 secondsPursuit's suggestion less than a secondsZroth's orginal answer took just over 2 secondsAnsari's suggest was slower than the original loop
11586007	EditPursuit is right: Using a for-loop and appropriate indexing seems to be the way to go here. Here's one way of doing it:Original answerI've looked for something similar before, but I never came across a good solution. A modification of one of the algorithms used here gives a slight performance boost in my tests:Ugly? Definitely. Like I said, it seems to be slightly faster (2--3 times faster for me); but both algorithms are clocking in at under a second for m = 3000 and n = 1000 (on a rather old computer, too).It might be worth noting that, for me, both algorithms seem to outperform the algorithm provided by Ansari, though his answer is certainly more straightforward. (Ansari's algorithm's output does not agree with the other two algorithms for me; but that could just be a discrepancy in how the shifts are being applied.) In general, arrayfun seems pretty slow when I've tried to use it. Cell arrays also seem slow to me. But my testing might be biased somehow.

11589837	I'm running a function that checks whether or not an user has already submitted a question. I've narrowed the problem down to my function which runs a query code. For some reason it is not working. The function does work when the part that involved AND user_requester... is not there. I'm sure it's some sort of syntax error but I don't get a response from the error reporting. Here is the code below:Clarification: I want to prevent an user from submitting the same question twice. That is the purpose of adding the AND section to the where clause in the query. When I do add the AND section, everything goes to pieces and the user can submit the same question anyways.
11589854	Add curly braces to your variable in the query.
11589989	I would try doing all steps separately so you can test the result of each operation individually. Your return line is handling a lot of things and so it's hard to tell where you problem is. Something like this...If this still doesn't help and you haven't already, dump your $question and $user_id vars to make sure that you are receiving them and your sanitize function isn't doing something incorrectly.

11598556	The program below should do this:When the user input: The quick brown fox. Jumps over. The lazy dog. It should output: God yzal eth. Revo spmuj. Xof nworb kciuq eht.But instead when the user input: The quick brown fox. Jumps over. The lazy dog.It outputs: xof nworb kciuq ehT. revo spmuJ . god yzal ehT . So here's my code:I also thought of this:but revo spmuJ . god yzal ehT . kciuq. nworb. xof. Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException at java.util.StringTokenizer.nextToken(Unknown Source) at ScrambleParagraph.main(Reverse.java:40) Please help me fix it. I've been thinking the correct implementation for a couple of days but I'm new in Java so I can't really do far, at least for now. Thank you very much!
11598727	How about splitting the input by "." first and then reversing each element?Output:
11598865	This is roughly how I would do it:Given the input: "The quick brown fox. Jumps over. The lazy dog."This produces: "God yzal eht. Revo spmuj. Xof nworb kciuq eht."It seems to be what you asked for.The special ingredients are: StringBuilder.reverse() which reverses a string and String.split(regex) which splits a string into pieces based on a regular expression. I use this to loop through each sentence in the paragraph after I've reversed it.
11604288	I wrote an interface MyInterface, which is going to be implemented by different implementors.I also wrote a class MyInterfaceTest, which contains generic test methods that all implementors should be able to use to test their implementations.I just don't know how to make it work as a JUnit test.Currently, I have something like this:I use the static method setUpBeforeClass because the initialization of each implementation takes a lot of time, so I want to initialize it once for all tests.With this version of the test, implementors have to change the code of setUpBeforeClass and put their own implementation. I am sure that there is another way to write MyInterfaceTest, so that implementors will only have to inherit it or send it a parameter, and not change the code. However, I am not experienced enough in JUnit to make it work. Can you please show me how to do this?
11604289	You can have the subclass implement just the before class method and inherit all the tests.This makes the abstract class you are writing look like:Normally, you would make the method the subclasses needed to implement abstract. Can't do that here since it is a static setup method. (In addition, you might want to refactor the instantiations to not take a long time as this is often an anti-pattern).
11604290	You should download a jar names junit-4.10.jar and add it to your project.Then let your class MyInterfaceTest inherit the class names TestCase, like "public class MyInterfaceTest extends TestCase ".
11607936	I've been working on a CSS minifier for PHP that's done except for one thing:I'd like to have it detect the user's browser and determine whether the user needs border-radius, -webkit-border-radius, -moz-border-radius, etc. So that I dont have to use the very long and annoying groups.This would either detect all instances of -webkit, -moz, etc. border-radius and merge them OR I would place {vendor}border-radius into the CSS file which would then be replaced by either -webkit-, -moz-, or nothing. The first one is ideal because I'd like for it to be expandable to other projects.For the life of me, I can't figure out a working PHP implementation that accurately detects which prefix to use (and I've googled/searched everywhere I could think of).Any help would be much appreciated!
11607968	The main issue here is that PHP (the server) won't know the CSS capabilities of your browser off-hand (the client). The only information that's remotely close to identifying a browser that would get sent to PHP is the user-agent string. Even then, you would still need to research the CSS capabilities of a specific version of a specific browser or engine, based on what you find through parsing the user-agent string, and hard-code some decision-making code based on that information.I think that's the main liability of trying to use server-side code to determine the CSS capabilities of a client. There may be others, but this seems the biggest hurdle, unfortunately.On the client side, there exist scripts like -prefix-free that make adding prefixes a trivial job; just serve your minified CSS with only the unprefixed properties and rules, and let the script add the prefixes for you based on what it knows about the browser (that the server doesn't).The first paragraph from this entry in its FAQ also seems worth a read: “Something like this belongs to the server-side”  A server side script would need to add all prefixes, making the size of the CSS file considerably larger. Also, it should maintain a list of features that need prefixes, or add them all and unnecessarily bloat the stylesheet. -prefix-free automatically detects what needs a prefix and what doesn’t.As well as an interview with its author, which it links to: "This is something better done on the server. Do it once instead of on every pageload"  What -prefix-free exactly does, is impossible to do in the server. -prefix-free detects which features need a prefix and only adds it if needed. Also, it automatically detects which properties are available that need a prefix. It doesn't have to keep lists of which prefixes to add for which features, everything gets feature detected, and thus is very future proof. With preprocessors, lists need to be maintained about this sort of stuff. Such lists are doomed to be incomplete and quickly get out of date. Every server-side prefixer I ever tried fails in a number of cases.(Emphases mine.)

11610764	I am using struts2 for my web application and i want to use osgi architecture for service and dao layer.

Now can anybody tell me how my non osgi actions can consume osgi bundles(service and dao layer). And I want to deploy my struts2 web application in web container so how web container will interact with osgi container(where my service and dao is deployed) in this case . Please help .
11613263	You need a so called 'bridge' between your web container and your OSGi environment.Both Felix and Equinox have that capability, but for me the Felix implementation worked much better.What you basically want to do is: Add a context listener to your ServletContextStarting OSGi when starting the ServletContext, stop it when the ServletContext gets destroyed.Pass the ServletContext to the OSGi context by registering it as a serviceStore the OSGi framework object in the ServletContext by registering it as an attribute.So to access the web context from OSGi: Retrieve the ServletContext service, and go from there.To access OSGi from the webcontext: Retrieve the OSGi framework from the ServletContext attribute and go from there.Check the Felix Documentation, also I've made an example a while back on GitHub
11613298	Most surely this will not work. Why do you think it should be a good idea to move half of your application to OSGi? Either you should move all of it or none.You may be able to deploy the struts layer in a war file and a access the OSGi services from it. I think this is possible in Virgo and Apache Karaf. It means to enhance the war with OSGi structures. For example in Karaf you can use a wab file which is a war file with a Manifest.
11632731	I suppose a definition of native and built-in objects is required to answer this question. Here's what the ECMAScript spec defines these as: 4.3.6 native object  object in an ECMAScript implementation, independent of the host environment, that is present at the start of the execution of an ECMAScript program.  NOTE Standard native built-in objects are defined in this specification. Some native objects are built-in; others may be constructed during the course of execution of an ECMAScript program  4.3.7 built-in object   object supplied by an ECMAScript implementation, independent of the host environment, that is present at the start of the execution of an ECMAScript program  NOTE Standard built-in objects are defined in this specification, and an ECMAScript implementation may specify and define others. Every built-in object is a native object. A built-in constructor is a built-in object that is also a constructor.I'm looking forward to an explanation of this one.
11632793	Native object - means implemented not in ECMAScript itself. Buiilt-in object - the one that's provided by the engine. Think Math, String and such.
11633047	Here is what ES5 shows: 4.3.6 native object # Ⓣ  object in an ECMAScript implementation whose semantics are fully defined by this specification rather than by the host environment.  NOTE Standard native objects are defined in this specification. Some native objects are built-in; others may be constructed during the course of execution of an ECMAScript program.  4.3.7 built-in object # Ⓣ  object supplied by an ECMAScript implementation, independent of the host environment, that is present at the start of the execution of an ECMAScript program.  NOTE Standard built-in objects are defined in this specification, and an ECMAScript implementation may specify and define others. Every built-in object is a native object. A built-in constructor is a built-in object that is also a constructor.As you can see, it's different that what you've shown.Built-in objects are native objects made available by the ECMAScript-compliant engine. For example:StringObjectArrayUndefinedBooleanetc.A native object is, for example:Or the list shown before. Built-in objects are native.Also, you didn't show it, but a host object is an object dependant on the environment. For example, in browsers, the host object is window. There are other host objects such as document or XMLHttpRequest though.
11643950	Possible Duplicate: Are Getters and Setters evil? I can't find a logical reason behind having a private variable with a getter and a setter that does nothing but directly handling the value being preferable to having a public variable.Am I missing something?
11643982	Because,Validation is one reason. Keeping the field name out of the public API also allows you to change it later without breaking the API. And it allows you to change the class later in other ways as well, e.g. moving the field to some other class (so that the public setter would call a setter in a different class). Having the setter called also allows you to do other things, e.g. notify interested other components of the change of value. None of this would be possible if the field was accessed directly.
11644220	I can't find a logical reason behind having a private variable with a getter and a setter that does nothing but directly handling the value being preferable to having a public variable.Consider that any additional code that you put into getters and setters adds to complexity and also needs to be tested. For a small system which is fully controlled by you, there may be little benefit in using getters and setters. Use your professional judgement. You may not need the future proofing and added complexity. Or it may be more important to you to have the efficiency and simplicity of direct access.Personally, I think that getters and setters are over-used. For a small system which is fully controlled by you, direct access may be the way to go.

Am I on the right track going about this? Any tips, code, or references will be much appreciated.Thanks!
11657535	Using Javascript you can only count the hits from the current user, because you have to save the count in a cookie or a client side technology.For a more accurate way you have to use a server-side language and maybe add a storage engine like a database to make it work.I suggest you start here Php for beginners the link might be old but it covers all the basics you need to know to create your counter.
11657548	A simple loop seems like it will do the job. Without having details, I would assume a loop would do it. To keep track even after the website closes, i've used simple .txt files saved on the server that kept track. However, you will have to use a server side language to load the counter text file.
11670278	The problem is in this line:The parenthesis closes the column/constraint declarations, but you include a constraint after that, which is throwing the error. Remove that parenthesis and you should be set. The correct code should be this:I'm guessing on the table structure of Parent, obviously, since I just needed a table there to fulfill the foreign key constraint on parent_id. You can verify that this works in a fiddle. Finally, you really should look at the section of this answer titled " A bit more information on how to methodically fix errors like this ", since it would make debugging CREATE TABLE statements a lot easier for you (as has been suggested before).

11698213	I am writing my own string class for really just for learning and cementing some knowledge. I have everything working except I want to have a constructor that uses move semantics with an std::string. Within my constructor I need to copy and null out the std::string data pointers and other things, it needs to be left in an empty but valid state, without deleting the data the string points to, how do I do this?So far I have this
11698237	There is no way to do this. The implementation of std::string is implementation-defined. Every implementation is different.Further, there is no guarantee that the string will be contained in a dynamically allocated array. Some std::string implementations perform a small string optimization, where small strings are stored inside of the std::string object itself.
11698494	I am interpreting the question as "can I make the move constructor result in correct behavior" and not "can I make the move constructor optimally fast".If the question is strictly, "is there a portable way to steal the internal memory from std::string", then the answer is "no, because there is no 'transfer memory ownership' operation provided in the public API".The following quote from this explanation of move semantics provides a good summary of "move constructors"... C++0x introduces a new mechanism called "rvalue reference" which, among other things, allows us to detect rvalue arguments via function overloading. All we have to do is write a constructor with an rvalue reference parameter. Inside that constructor we can do anything we want with the source, as long as we leave it in some valid state.Based on this description, it seems to me that you can implement the "move semantics" constructor (or "move constructor") without being obligated to actually steal the internal data buffers.An example implementation:As I understand it, the point of move semantics is that you can be more efficient if you want to. Since the incoming object is transient, its contents do not need to be preserved -- so it is legal to steal them, but it is not mandatory. Maybe, there is no point to implementing this if you aren't transferring ownership of some heap-based object, but it seems like it should be legal. Perhaps it is useful as a stepping stone -- you can steal as much as is useful, even if that isn't the entire contents.By the way, there is a closely related question here in which the same kind of non-standard string is being built and includes a move constructor for std::string. The internals of the class are different however, and it is suggested that std::string may have built-in support for move semantics internally (std::string -> std::string).

11700926	From the Oracle (Java) docs:A class can have any number of static initialization blocks, and they can appear anywhere in the class body. The runtime system guarantees that static initialization blocks are called in the order that they appear in the source code.Here is the entire link

11701022	The reflection does not "catch" the System.out. Of course you have picked and the most hardest example - String and that is because java String class is a very "interesting" class where each String is not an object but spawned in a pool of Strings and is by itself immutable.What your code does is that in the java String class it statically(which would mean before execution time) sets the value of the String "Hello World" to "G`Day Mate.". This means that whenever you use the string "Hello World" it would be changed to "G`Day Mate.". Example:Hope the example helps a bit.Interesting remark, the code:Produces output:Which means that in the mapping the white space makes some difference, but I do not know how that effects the String object and the function of the reflect.
11703844	I have a table with n number of recordsHow can i retrieve the nth record and (n-1)th record from my table in SQL without using derived table ?I have tried using ROWID asIt is giving the nth record but i want the (n-1)th record also .And is there any other method other than using max,derived table and pseudo columnsThanks
11703942	Assuming 'rowid' is a column in your table:SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY rowid DESC LIMIT 2
11703967	You cannot depend on rowid to get you to the last row in the table. You need an auto-incrementing id or creation time to have the proper ordering.You can use, for instance:Although allowed in the syntax, the order by clause in a subquery is ignored (for instance ).Just to be clear, rowids have nothing to do with the ordering of rows in a table. The Oracle documentation is quite clear that they specify a physical access path for the data (http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28318/datatype.htm#i6732). It is true that in an empty database, inserting records into a newtable will probably create a monotonically increasing sequence of row ids. But you cannot depend on this. The only guarantees with rowids are that they are unique within a table and are the fastest way to access a particular row.I have to admit that I cannot find good documentation on Oracle handling or not handling order by's in subqueries in its most recent versions. ANSI SQL does not require compliant databases to support order by in subqueries. Oracle syntax allows it, and it seems to work in some cases, at least. My best guess is that it would probably work on a single processor, single threaded instance of Oracle, or if the data access is through an index. Once parallelism is introduced, the results would probably not be ordered. Since I started using Oracle (in the mid-1990s), I have been under the impression that order bys in subqueries are generally ignored. My advice would be to not depend on the functionality, until Oracle clearly states that it is supported.
11704971	Seems like the following code should return a true, but it returns false. How does this make sense?
11705001	This is a workaround: Object.toJSON(obj1) == Object.toJSON(obj2)By converting to string, comprasion will basically be in strings
11705017	The only difference between regular (==) and strict (===) equality is that the strict equality operator disables type conversion. Since you're already comparing two variables of the same type, the kind of equality operator you use doesn't matter.Regardless of whether you use regular or strict equality, object comparisons only evaluate to true if you compare the same exact object.That is, given var a = {}, b = a, c = {};, a == a, a == b, but a != c.Two different objects (even if they both have zero or the same exact properties) will never compare equally. If you need to compare the equality of two object's properties, this question has very helpful answers.
11708251	I have a site where i want to allow a 5 star rating on various things. However, like many other people asking questions on SO, i only want to allow one vote per person.At first i was planning on logging the IP address when a vote happens and just scan to see if the current IP had voted before or not which would work great. But then i realized a problem, the site is designed for college students at one particular school. A couple issues with this if i understand IP correctly:People using school computers/connected to the school wifi will have the same IP(maybe a handful, but not unique to each computer)Many people live in houses of 4-8 people, where they would all share the same IP(assuming they are on the same network)How could i detect unique votes without using IP addresses or having a user login? Is there any other way to do something like this?Or maybe i am misunderstanding how IP addresses work and i can still use that - hopefully this is the case.Thanks
11708273	You can do this any way you want. There is no "one right way".On the extreme end, you can have users submit a blood sample when they request an account. You can then check new blood samples against your database. This could result in people submitting family member's blood samples. If that's a concern, you may wish to have them sign a contract, notarized most likely, stating that they have submitted their own blood sample.You could also have them personally register at your office. You could, for example, collect fingerprints and compare them to your database.IP addresses are not very useful for this purpose. Some people have access to dozens of IP addresses and in some cases many people share a single IP address.You could only give a vote to users who have made a large number of intelligent posts to a forum. That would at least cut down on the ease with which people can create voting accounts.
11708282	I am not sure if it can be implemented in your application but try logging for unique MAC address instead of unique IP address. MAC address are universally unique for each network controller and usually PC just has one.
11709699	First of all, you need to know that bada 2.0 environment supports all the versions of the sdk, it means that you can build 1.0 bada application with 2.0 environment, you should just mentioned this in your manifest Second, not all the versions support all resolutions, this is a schema illustrating this:version of bada | resolutions | devices1.0 | 480x800 | wave 11.1 | 240x400 | Wave575 , Wave578 , Wave7231.2 | 480x800 | wave 22.0 | 480x800 | wave 3 2.0 | 320x480 | wave M/Y 2.0 | 240x400 | no official deviceSo, if you select for example 1.0 in your application, it should run on 1.0, 1.2, and 2.0 devices you should just pay attention to the features that are supported in 2.0 and not supported in 1.2 and 1.1, ans also to the methods that are deprecated in 2.0 SDKHope I'm clear, if not, just ask ;), best regards
11716865	I am trying to create an algorithm that detects and counts dead pixels from an intensity map in .csv format. My current approach is to divide the value of the pixel I am testing by the value of the pixel immediately to the right (or, if on the far right side, the one to the left). If the dividend is less than some threshold (currently .9), then I mark it as a dead pixel.My question is, is there a better/more efficient way to calculate if a pixel is dead?Sample csv output:In this example, the middle pixel would be a "dead" pixel.
11717600	Your current approach won't help you if you have a cluster of dead pixels. It can also misinterpret a stuck pixel (pixel with 100% intensity) as valid pixel and the surrounding pixel as defect, depending on the image that was used to test the screen.Instead calculate the overall average µ and variance σ2 of your data and interpret the data as normal distributed. According to the 68-95-99.7 rule 95% of all data should be in the interval [µ-2σ,µ+2σ].Lets have a look at your sample and determine whether this is true for your data:This will result in the dead pixels (8% of total pixels) revealed. Note that I also added a pixel with a very high intensity, which is probably stuck:However, there is one major drawback, as this approach will only work if the screen equally illuminated. Also stuck pixel cannot be detected if you recorded the intensity map with a plain white image. And, of course, if your data is scattered because the screen is completely broken, this approach won't help you. Other than that it's easy to implement. You could also add a local check to filter false-positives.Note that this algorithm has a fixed runtime of 3*n.(The diagram has been created by Mwtoews)
11719877	Consider an AIR application which can load any number of third-party SWF files one at a time for display. Like a Web Browser.The problem is that these SWF files may have EventListeners which have not been removed, etc.Will Loader.unloadAndStop() be enough to garbage collect these SWFs? If not- is there an approach which will (maybe a new NativeWindow for each SWF, then close the NativeWindow when done. Will that completely GC?)
11720191	You should make a public static function to remove all the listeners in the loaded swf file(s) before you GC it.
11720804	Separate native window or loading inside a browser control can be a way for third party SWFs you have no control over. This adds a lot of overhead otherwise.Unfortunately, you cannot ensure proper sandboxing of the loaded code (the display objects, most importantly, stage cannot be hidden from the loaded code). If the loaded code had added a listener to stage (which is a common thing to do if you need keyboard events), then it will not unload.This is, however, impossible on mobile devices, where SWF format itself is different.
11722891	Is it possible to let an Android (>4.0) device establish a WiFi-Direct connection with a Mac OS or Windows device?
11723207	According to the Wifi-Direct Docs the protocol allows: Android 4.0 (API level 14) or later devices with the appropriate hardware to connect directly to each other via Wi-Fi It doesn't look like Google provides this functionality via the API. Although WiFi-Direct isn't a proprietary protocol and could be implemented for any platform. There are a few posts around the web of people trying to get Wifi-Direct to work under windows:Broadcast message from Desktop PC to Android Device using WIFI connectivity
11723333	All you need is to use java.net.Socket. Depends on what do you mean by establish direct connection. TCP connection is established when on destination device (windows or mac) you open listening socket by ServerSocket. On other device you can use Socket with destination address. Of course, windows or mac box will propably have to open that port in firewall.I guess what you actually need to know is how to get name of target computer or how to discover computers on local network. Unfortunately, it does not depend on android version I think. You should check  about some hints. I fear there might be problem in need to open privileged port on android, as normally you have to be root for that. And that would require rooted android.Of course you should specify what do you intend with that direct connection and what software do you need. If both ends have your application, you can just open any not allocated and unpriviledged port on android. Use UDP to broadcast periodically name of android device (propably ask user to enter name of his device). Use multicast to send requests, and receive replies the same way. Multicast sending and receiving would require your application on android and on windows and on mac also. Now you can read from multicast application what type of machine it is, and what local port it left open for your direct connection. From source of udp message you know where to connect. You may use some framework to speed things up. All this require some knowledge about networking, but I don't know simpler and well working solution. Unless you provide details about what is your direct connection to do.

11728918	Bubble Sort source
11728990	First thing which is wrong with your code is:Your check i &lt; n - j will never let the control to fall through the loop. Because you have initialized n to 0 and j is 1 (after j++), so i is not going to be less then -1, Thus your loop will not work as intended. Since you set the swapped to false, the control will fall out of the while loop, hence no sorting. You need to change your code to:

11731786	I'm new to javascript and probably trying to do something stupid since an hour of googling didn't result in any examples.I'm trying to learn objects so I made a constructor function like this:Next I will create a new instance of that object with something like:...but now I'm really stuck because the next parameter I should pass to the function is actually a huge array with hundreds of values..I tried to put the array inside the argument like this:but this gives me a syntax error.I don't want to make this array a global variable either. What is the correct syntax of passing an array of values as a part of the function call's arguments?EDIT:Here is the actual code:Hmmmm actually I think my problem is the semicolon at the end of array right? :D

11733814	While reading the answers to this SO question, I learned that out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic is undefined. Indeed, according to C99 6.5.6 paragraph 8  If both the pointer operand and the result point to elements of the same array object, or one past the last element of the array object, the evaluation shall not produce an overflow; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.Does freeing that object invalidate that guarantee? 7.20.3.2 "The Free Function" Doesn't seem to mention it, simply mentioning that "the space is deallocated". Since 6.5.6 specifically mentions overflow, it seems like an integer overflow issue, which free wouldn't affect. Is arithmetic on a pointer to an object an act of "referring to it"?In other words, is:Undefined? Or is the usage of "overflow" a different one?
11733818	So i've run into an annoying issue where i've set a wide border (15px) on a &lt;div&gt; and I have an element that is floated right inside of that &lt;div&gt; with a negative margin to top so that it slightly overlaps the border. This was working fine until I set the &lt;div&gt; to overflow-y:scroll and now instead of the the text overlapping the border the border overlaps the text. I'm at a loss as to why this occurs and how to fix it. live demo | the h1 element at the top of each .window is being overlapped by the border but if you disable the overflow-y:scroll on .window then it is fine. What i've tried so farI tried giving the h1 a higher z-index than the .window
11733857	Giving your h1 element a position: absolute should help.
11733959	Try this on the h1:
11733972	C99 §6.2.4 says: The value of a pointer becomes indeterminate when the object it points to reaches the end of its lifetime.§7.20.3 describes the lifetime of allocated objects, as created by malloc(): The lifetime of an allocated object extends from the allocation until the deallocation.So, formally speaking, the value of the pointer foo becomes indeterminate after the free(), and therefore can no longer be said to point to any object. The behaviour of the increment is therefore undefined.
11734657	Here foo is a pointer variable, which is going to store address of a char. Actually that address will be a virtual address. So if we perform any pointer arithmetic on the variable foo will leads to increase the values according to the type of pointer variable. This will not be treated as undefined behaviour.

But NSJSONSerialzation doesn't ask for what encoding it requires, it i guess detects it by itself. So my question is, how can I get proper strings instead of these weird &amp;auml ; and %#339;.
11762053	In options try NSJSONReadingMutableLeaves, it must return NSMutableString.. For more take a look at the docs.
11762186	NSJSONSerialization assumes the encoding is one of the Unicode encodings. Make sure the data you pass to it is in UTF-8 (or UTF-16). ä is C3 A4 in UTF-8 or E4 in UTF-16. Note that the default encoding for HTTP if none is specified is ISO-8859-1, so it may be that you are passing ISO-8859-1 data instead of UTF-8.
11764092	I am using LibSVM to train SVM on a highly imbalanced data set. 10% of the output is true while 90% is false. I read about weight parameter:What should be the parameter set for each of the class? What does this weight parameter mean intuitively and how should we use it?
11765271	The weight parameter controls the skewedness of the SVM optimisation. That is, classes with a higher weight will count more. If the weight for a class is 3 times as much as for another, an instance of the class of the lower weight can be 3 times as far away from the boundary between the classes that libsvm determines as an instance of the other class to get the same optimisation value.How you use this is entirely up to you -- you could set it such that the two classes are equally weighted (i.e. a weight of 9 for true), but if the results you get with this actually improve on using the same weights is a different matter.I'd suggest that you play around with different weights to see what happens.

11778263	There's no such "elegant" way.The only way to do this is to have some special value, that will indicate "not filled". For example, The other option is to have a bitmap, which will tell you which positions are filled, which - not.
11778303	well you must ask if your array in position "i" is ==NULL something like this
11779361	My basic situation: I have an include file that has something like #define foo (Flag1 | Flags2 | Flag3), so it's a predefined combination of bit flags. For the sake of type-safety, I wanted to replace these #defines by static consts, i.e. static const int foo = (Flag1 | Flag2 | Flag3) (or similar). This include file is included in dozens of places in the program.Now when I'm doing a release build with all relevant optimisation options enabled (using the C++ compiler of VS2010), replacing the #defines seems to increase the executable by a few KiB, depending on how many constants I replaced.Why does this happen? To my knowledge, integer constants are supposed to be "inlined" into the ASM code that is produced if possible, and I don't see how using a static const vs #define would make a difference here. Clearly, the variable isn't inlined as the disassembly shows:So the final question is: How can I avoid #define but still rely on the variable being inserted directly into the generated assembly?
11779747	You can solve your problem by looking at it from another perspective: you may put the data and the functions that use it close together.In an OO language, this means making your constant foo a private static attribute of a class. This class should have as public methods all the functions that use foo.Being a static private attribute, it will be defined in the .cpp file, and there will be just one instance of it in the executable footprint.I understand this would be a big change in your code, and not a simple refactorying: surely it's not as simple as modifying the definition of foo from #define to a static global constant. But keeping data and methods that use them close together (i.e.: in the same class) will bring you many non-functional advantages.
11780056	There is no reason the compiler couldn't eliminate the static const variable. If you're compiling with optimizations turned on, I'm surprised that VC++ doesn't do that.I tried compiling this code with gcc.With optimizations turned off, it inlined the value but still reserved storage space for the variable.At O2 it inlined the value and got rid of the storage space.My only thought other that incorrect compiler settings, or VC++ failing to make this optimization, is that the Flags variables might not be compile-time constants which would mean that the value of the expression has to be computed at program start-up, which would prevent inlining.

11782690	B *b3(b2); doesn't do what you think.It's equivalent to B* b3 = b2. The pointers will point to the same location. When you do delete b2;, you're also freeing the memory pointed to by b3.To do a deep copy, do:There's also undefined behaviour here:because you never return. Change the return type to void.To get the value expected:
11782770	There is no such things as shallow/deep copy in c++. You either have values or pointers/references that get copied, and that fully defines the semantics of the copy operation.

11787340	abc is the name of a standard library module distributed with Python, so I strongly suggest you change the name to something that is unique.Assuming you've done that, you can either put the module's file(s) in the same directory as the script that imports it and it will be found. If you want to put it somewhere else, you can append the path to its location to the sys.path variable. Here's an example:Note that the above won't work unless you change the module's name because Python will find the standard module before it looks in the directory path you've appended. You could override that by inserting your module's path at the beginning of the sys.path list, but again I don't recommend doing that.If you'd like your module's path automatically appended to the system's module search path, you can create a name.pth file and put it in one of four special directories. See the online documentation for the site.py file for the details.

11802807	Will modules make template compilation faster? Templates (usually) have to be header only, and end up residing in the translation unit of the #includer. Related: Do precompiled headers make template compilation faster?
11802983	According to modules proposal, from the very paper you cited, it's the first of the three primary goals for adding modules: 1 Introduction  Modules are a mechanism to package libraries and encapsulate their implementations.  They differ from the traditional approach of translation units and header ﬁles primarily in  that all entities are deﬁned in just one place (even classes, templates, etc.). This paper  proposes a module mechanism (somewhat similar to that of Modula-2) with three  primary goals:   Signiﬁcantly improve build times of large projects Enable a better separation between interface and implementation Provide a viable transition path for existing libraries While these are the driving goals, the proposal also resolves a number of other longstanding practical C++ issues (initialization ordering, run-time performance, etc.). So, how can they accomplish those goals? Well, from section 4.1: Since header ﬁles are typically included in many other ﬁles, the  growth in build cycles is generally superlinear with respect to the total amount of source  code. If the issue is not addressed, it is likely to become worse as the use of templates  increases and more powerful declarative facilities (like concepts, contract programming,  etc.) are added to the language.  Modules address this issue by replacing the textual inclusion mechanism (whose  processing time is roughly proportional to the amount of code included) by a precompiled  module attachment mechanism (whose processing time—when properly implemented— is roughly proportional to the number of imported declarations). The property that client  translation units need not be recompiled when private module deﬁnitions change can be  retained.In other words, at the very least, the time taken to parse these templates is only done once instead of N times, which is already a huge improvement. Later sections describe improvements for things like explicit instantiation. The one thing this doesn't directly improve is automatic template instantiation, as section 5.8 acknowledges. Here all that can be guaranteed is exactly the same benefit you already get from precompiled headers: "Both modules Set and Reset must instantiate Lib::S and in fact both expose this instantiation in their interface file." But the proposal then gives some possible technical solutions to the ODR problems, at least some of which also solve the multiple-instantiation problem and may not be possible in today's world. For example, the kind of queried instantiation suggested has been tried repeatedly and it's generally considered too hard to get right with today's model, but modules might make it feasible. There's no proof that it's impossible to get right today, just experience that it's hard, and there's no proof that it would be easier with modules, just the plausible possibility that it might be.And that fits with a general implication that's never quite stated in the proposal, but is there in the background: Making compilation simpler means we might get new optimizations in the process (directly, because it's easier to reason about what's happening, or indirectly, because more people work on the problem once it's not such a huge pain).In summary, modules can and will definitely make template compilation faster, if for no other reason than that the template definitions themselves only have to be parsed once. They may allow for other benefits that are either impossible or more difficult to do without modules, but that may not be guaranteeable.
11803608	I'm attempting to follow this tutorial:  on installing ffmpeg on MAMP (for use with Drupal, which is incidental)I'm stuck here:You should also execute in your Terminalwhich should point to your MAMP installation:...but when I do it, which php pecl phpize says it's pointing to /usr/bin/php (and pecl and phpize respectively). If I do ln /usr/bin/php /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.3.6/bin/php it says 'file already exists'. How do I point to the right file?
11803684	TryIf it shows something like /usr/bin/php -&gt; /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.x.x/bin in the last column you're all good. Otherwise, you might have to uninstall the non-MAMP php installation.EDIT: You can also put the MAMP php path before /usr/bin in your $PATH. The first step in the linked tutorial tells you how to do that.
11803731	Your $PATH is wrong, which means that something went wrong in the first step of that tutorial: First of all point your php and phpize to your MAMP environment Add/change following line in ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc (for bash):  and after that please re-login (or just execute e.g. /bin/bash).Did you remember to re-login?Let me also add, doing something like your attempted fix with ln is generally not a good idea. /usr/bin generally contains system-installed software and may depend on that software being the correct version in the correct location. If you want to use a different version of PHP for something, the standard practice is to install it somewhere else, like /usr/local/bin, and then have that directory listed before /usr/bin in your $PATH. That way you'll use your version, while the system will still have its version to use.
11804079	Do precompiled headers make template compilation faster?No; it makes templates not compile. Which is the entire point of both PCHs and modules: to stop compiling everything.The idea is to turn "load C++ text and compile" into "load C++ symbols." Modules are a generalized form of PCHs.Now, you still have the cost of instantiating templates (unless they were instantiated within a PCH/module). But the cost of compiling the C++ template code is removed.
11804721	Hi guys quick question: If i send two messages over the same html5 websocket a few hundred milliseconds apart from each other, is it theoretically possible for them to arrive in a different order than they were sent?
11804727	Yes (theoretically), that's why TCP/IP packets have sequence numbers. In practice I don't think it has ever happened to me and I've written A LOT of network code.
11806196	I've seen several other posts about this, but the answers from those responses don't work for me.The other responses:How do I bind a google maps geocoder.geocode() callback functionBackbone.js with Google Maps - problems with this and listenersMy code:The offending line:The error being reported in firebug: TypeError: func is undefined  underscore.js (line 482)
11806228	I suspect this.marker is the problem, since you should be able to just refer to it by name.
11809503	Short answer: No.Long answer:WebSocket runs over TCP, so on that level @EJP 's answer applies. WebSocket can be "intercepted" by intermediaries (like WS proxies): those are allowed to reorder WebSocket control frames (i.e. WS pings/pongs), but not message frames when no WebSocket extension is in place. If there is a neogiated extension in place that in principle allows reordering, then an intermediary may only do so if it understands the extension and the reordering rules that apply.

11817677	is there any way to disable Appbar in snapview state ?! i'm using HTML5 and javascript to build my application
11818084	Snapped view and other view states are an integral part of the Windows 8 user experience and cannot be disabled. Apps need to be prepared to handle snapped, filled, fullscreen-landscape, and fullscreen-portrait.As for the app bar, just don't declare one in the app. For example, create a new project using the Blank project template in Visual Studio or Blend and you'll see that it has no appbar behavior.If you're asking whether you can disable the charms bar (swiped in from the right edge), then no, you cannot disable that. Again, it's an integral part of the system.

Of course, I need to be able to do this in java, not XML. I tried the following which failed to work: ImageButton.setImageResource(null); I also looked around a bit and couldn't find an answer... Thanks in advance for any help.EDIT: Thank you all for your answers.. Péter Varga's answer did exactly what I needed so that's what i'm going with.
11835365	Try setting imageButton.setImageResource(android.R.color.transparent).
11835425	First of all, you will never be able to send a null value to the setImageResource function, as it takes an integer.This integer represents a pointer to the resource that you are trying to access.For instance:One way to do it, might be to use the setAlpha method that you have inherited from the View class.This will render the ImageButton transparent.Like so:If you need the the button to be removed from the layout ( and thus not take up any space ).You could remove and add the ImageButton rather than altering its properties.To remove the button, you can do something that looks like:To add the button again, you could then do something along the lines of:Where layout of course is what ever layout you are using to contain the button.Good luck onwards!

Obtain is called every time, but if the repository already exists at the destination, update if called instead of clone. Since rev_options defaults to "origin/master", update resets to this branch.

But it does prints '0' instead, after the insert query. For example, if the inserted ($_REQUEST['user_min']) value is "Brisbane" and the ($_REQUEST['user_branch']) value is null (because I didn't selected any value under the user_branch drop-down list), the branch field should just become "Brisbane", knowing that user_branch is NULL. But it does print "BRISBANE" with 0, like 0, Brisbane in my mysql table.How can I fix this?I already tried putting an if condition, it did not work.I've also tried changing the user_min into same name user_branch, but it does not get the selected value, instead of Brisbane it just prints '0'
11848299	A few things - you are setting user_branch = NULL after the $sql.You are using quotes around value. It's fine non-Null values -you need to check if there is NULL value then don't use quotes in your $sql.You are using single "=" in your IF statement. This is failing your If statement. Change it to if($var == '')UpdateSome suggestions based on your existing code - however there are other best practices to achieve what you are trying to achieve....

11874892	Calling free() on the pointer does not change the pointer value. It will still point to the same memory that no longer belongs to your application. You should always assign NULL to a free'd pointer immediately after you free it to ensure that you don't use it again.
11874967	Take a look at this page.It clearly says:  Notice that this function leaves the value of ptr unchanged, hence it still points to the same (now invalid) location, and not to the null pointer.Note that it is up to you to make sure that pointer is not dereferenced after being freed.

I just want to know how to pass the variables to php, e.g. an array or somethingOk guys something like this:How would I get the table row data in an array to submit it? (Answer is below)Ok Part 2: Sending the table row data to php. jQuery code:PHP Code:Error:
11910571	You could use the jQuery library to make an AJAX request to a PHP script that then 'processed' the data in the table.You could also use the jQuery .each() function to perform this action on multiple rows.
11910713	submit rows using a $.post() and then, in the server side, you can convert back into an array using json_decode();Sample output:[{"name":"Water","units":"1","calories":"2","sugar":"3"},{"name":"Food","units":"4","calories":"5","sugar":"6"}]Demo:

Is it possible to write a library in C++ (preferably Visual C++) that can be executed using rundll32.exe and will run this code? If so, how?
11917097	Googling "rundll32", the 3rd hit was a link to documentation,According to that documentation, rundll32 calls a user-specified function with signature like wWinMain (except the first argument here is a window handle instead of an instance handle),So, trying this out:Building &amp; running:The output is presented in its own console window, created via AllocConsole, which is generally necessary since rundll32 is a GUI subsystem program (this is also the reason for the freopen calls).To present the output in an existing console window one can just omit the calls to AllocConsole and freopen, and redirect standard output of rundll32 to a pipe. E.g. standard output can be piped through Windows&rsquo; more when the output is just a few lines, or through some *nix-utility cat for more lines. However, in the standard command interpreter [cmd.exe] it doesn&rsquo;t work to just redirect the output to con.

11922248	You can't determine in PHP when the user closes the browser - as far as PHP is concerned, then the page is sent to the user, PHP is done with it.Instead of using cookies, you could use sessions to get a better contact with the user machine. You could do something like setting the session timeout to only a few minutes, but this will run the risk that someone who is a slow reader or takes their time moving from page to page will be locked out.If you want to be a real meanie when it comes to user logouts, you might have to do something like javascript'ing in a regular "check-in" that sends data to the server to keep the session alive - this along with a short session time might sort-of achieve the result you are looking for.Edit: the code you posted also shows old mysql_* functions, along with root user and no password to access the database. Please dead god tell me you just inserted that user as a placeholder. Secondly, please move on to PDO or mysqli to avoid getting your website hosed by the first annoyed user that comes along.You aren't even checking for $_POST data that contains a username of "bob; drop table users;" which means I could pop that in and your website is kaput. Google SQL Injection, fix your code. Right now. Seriously.Edit 2: As Adnan points out, you could set your cookie expiry date to 0 which will only keep it as long as the session is open. I generally think that keeping a username in a cookie is great, but leaving a password to be entered in by the user is better for securitym you could take this approach as well.Edit 3: based on your code:Why not just set a session variable along the lines of:when they log into the admin functions and change it to false when they log out of the admin functions? No need to kill off the entire session, just change a single variable kept in it.

11927583	Is there any way to hide the overflow of a fixed div with a container? I thought fixed inside fixed would do it, but it seems it's not the case. The only workaround I can think of is "inverted" masks: other fixed divs hiding everything around the one, but it'd be better if there are any other solutions.Here's the fiddle:
11927618	Is this what you were looking for:
11927698	Is there any way to "edit" a "server side" javascript file in one of the mentioned browsers that will save the js edits on the client side and replace the server side scripts?Basically I want to edit the javascripts on the server. Obviously I can't save them on the server so they need to be saved on the client side(my computer) and the browser needs to load my scripts instead.It shouldn't be hard to do at all but I've not been able to find any way to accomplish this. Edit:I want to modify the javascript's from a site I do not own or have write access too. e.g.,Html page uses some javascript page on server. I want to modify this javascript file(the actual file). I can download and save the javascript file BUT the html page will always use the one on the server because that is what is in the script tag. I need to modify the script tag of the html page to point to the local javascript file BEFORE the html page's scripts are executed(else the javascript from the server will be used).here, for example, is a script tag from SE:It uses a non-local javascript file. I need to replace this line with my own line before any javascript is executed. It would like like:or whatever. (this way, I can modify the jquery file and have it execute my own version of the one on the server)I, could, ofcourse, download the html file and modify it BUT then php code may not work among other things. (for example, relative links will be broke)
11927717	Build a string on the server side to write all your javascript code on the server side.
11927980	Unfortunately it seems to be impossible to nest a fixed element within another element (fixed or not) and expect the outer element to wrap it and hide any overflow. The only thing I can think of is setting the inner div to position:absolute instead of fixed. Here is an example based on your jsfiddle: jsfiddle.net/pjFa6/15 .
11930956	After further investigation the error could be identified: after several replies in an email thread an embedded HTML message had no lines break anymore.

11933558	Is there anyway I can download the SSL certificate of a server and verify it before trying to connect to it to send data in a blackberry device? I am using ((HttpsConnection)conn).getSecurityInfo(); but it gives a Certificate type which doesnt have much useful info. When i tried to check for the type, it said net.rim.device.api.crypto.certificate.CertificateUtilities . Is there any way i can cast this to a X509 Certificate so I have access to bit more useful information ?
11933690	Check the class net.rim.device.api.crypto.certificate.x509.X509CertificateUPDATE:Sorry, my previous answer was wrong: There are two interfaces in the API with the same class name: net.rim.device.api.crypto.certificate.Certificate (from which X509Certificate extends) and javax.microedition.pki.Certificate (the J2ME one). The latter is the one you can retrieve via HttpsConnection, and it is not very useful.So you are stuck with X509Certificate constructors, and to create an instance you'll need to download the certificate from the server first, or include it in your app resources. In this question you can see how to download a certificate from server:. However, this may not be an option for you.
11935750	I used a Java method called 'containsAll()' to check if ArrayLists have common content.Let's say I have a list A (one row), and several other lists in a MySQL table (in column 'name', row by row). All lists consist of comma-separated Strings (at least one String in a list) - names or whatever.Now, I want to check if all Strings in list A can be found in any of the rows in column 'name'. The result set should show all the rows in 'name' that match, that includes rows/lists must have all Strings in list A, and can have additional Strings.Example IA: 'Mr.T'Result set: 'Hannibal','Face','Murdock','Mr.T','Donald Duck' -AND-  'Superman',Chuck Norris','Mr.T'Example IIA: 'Rocky', 'Mr.T', 'Apollo'Result set: 'Apollo', 'Superman','Hannibal','Rocky','Mr.T','Chuck Norris' -AND-  'Rocky','Mr.T','Apollo','Cuck Norris'I wonder if one can carry out those results using a MySQL query.Thank you in advance.

11936153	It appears you want to do an array intersection, except your array is a single column. It can be done, but it will be slow, difficult to debug and will not leverage the power of relational databases. A better way would be to change your table schema to something like this:Table groupsTable members_in_groupThen you can query like this:The groups table is probably very like your current table. The members_in_groups table is the same data chopped up into easily searchable parts.ETA given your comment, this should work if you can guarantee that each character_list contains only one instance of each character:In this case the HAVING clause must equal 3 because there are 3 members in IN ('Mr. T', 'Apollo', 'Rocky').
11937097	I am storing numbers in a database with a string like 5,55,15,17,2,35I want to remove say number 5 from the string, keeping the comma seperation set like it is.The problem with using str_replace() is that all of the 5's will be removed. If i use str_replace('5,'', $string) thats fine, but the comma wouldn't be after the 5 if it was in the middle of the string or at the end. That same str_replace would also remove part of 15, and 55,Am i missing something?
11937137	You should:get the stringthen "explode" the values into an arrayand re-create the string without the number you want to remove.
11937146	You probably shouldn't be storing a comma separated list of values in a single database column in the first place. It looks like a one-to-many association, which should be modeled with a separate table.
11940434	this is usually very easy in Opera: Just view source, edit what you want and use the special "Tools > Advanced > Reload from cache" command instead of a normal reload.

Two months I spent time in vain behind this problem but result was none. Manually correct your time (year, hour, munite) or take help from internet TIME SYNCHRONIZATION from Control Panel - Date and Time - Internet Time - Update Now.

11963148	I'm working on some code that does some fairly heavy numerical work on a large (tens to hundreds of thousands of numerical integrations) set of problems. Fortunately, these integrations are embarassingly parallel, so it's easy to use Pool.map() to split up the work across multiple cores.Right now, I have a program that has this basic workflow:Since X, param_1, and param_2 are hard-coded and initialized in exactly the same way for each process in the pool, this all works fine. Now that I have my code working, I'd like to make it so that the file name, param_1, and param_2 are input by the user at run-time, rather than being hard-coded.One thing that should be noted is that X, param_1, and param_2 are not modified as the work is being done. Since I don't modify them, I could do something like this at the beginning of the program:And that would do the trick, but since most users of this code are running the code from Windows machines, I'd rather not go the route of command-line arguments.What I would really like to do is something like this:But, of course, this fails and X/param_1/param_2 are all None when the pool.map call happens. I'm pretty new to multiprocessing, so I'm not sure why the call to the initializer fails. Is there a way to do what I want to do? Is there a better way to go about this altogether? I've also looked at using shared data, but from my understanding of the documentation, that only works on ctypes, which don't include numpy arrays. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
11963538	To make your last idea work, I think you can simply make X, param_1, and param_2 global variables by using the global keyword before modifying them inside the if statement. So add the following:directly after the if __name__ == '__main__'.

This could be a way, but you could also modify the FastCGI wrapper script to define your own custom environment variable and test on that.
11998837	I'm a complete newbie to Eclipse and Android development and I've been trying to delete a project and then creating one with the same name again. I choose to delete the project from the workspace and the dir/files are indeed gone. The new AndroidManifest.xml file though has the original contents appended as does the layout XML file and generates parsererrors rightaway! Are references to the project file somehow stored outside the workspace dir itself that I can delete by hand? If I restart Eclipse after deleting the project, it doesn't give me this problem
11998873	Once you delete the project from the Workspace, in Windows it's at the User main Workspace/[The project] once you delete, your project goes to dream land. so you restart Esclipse and make new one with same name, thats not an issue.Umm, try searching in your mac about the project name, or go to the workspace and delete it, it should be enough.I found this, take a look at it, please:How to delete Eclipse completely (including settings and plugins) from Mac OS X?Sorry, but you can delete Eclipse, and re-install it as a secondary option, if u deleted the Dir, and your project name is still in-use x.xEDIT: in the link it says that you can change the workspace to another place, so I suggest you change the workspace place or delete the whole workspace after u take a backup of it.

Being a chat app it is of utmost importance to our users that we show dictionary suggestions. There are couple of other people who have posted similar question but they I think dint receive much community attention.

12028343	Or, you could add the . to your division, ie h = A .\ b
12029169	From typing help slash at the command prompt: \ Backslash or left division.  A\B is the matrix division of A into B, which is roughly the same as INV(A)*B , except it is computed in a different way. If A is an N-by-N matrix and B is a column vector with N components, or a matrix with several such columns, then X = A\B is the solution to the equation A*X = B. A warning message is printed if A is badly scaled or nearly singular. A\EYE(SIZE(A)) produces the inverse of A.   If A is an M-by-N matrix with M &lt; or > N and B is a column vector with M components, or a matrix with several such columns, then X = A\B is the solution in the least squares sense to the under- or overdetermined system of equations A*X = B. The effective rank, K, of A is determined from the QR decomposition with pivoting. A solution X is computed which has at most K nonzero components per column. If K &lt; N this will usually not be the same solution as PINV(A)*B. A\EYE(SIZE(A)) produces a generalized inverse of A.So, the second paragraph applies to your case. In other words, there is no H that can satisfy A*H = b for your problem, but Matlab computes the best approximation to it (in a least-squares sense). So the result you get is correct.

12059042	As @suszterpatt pointed out, your are working with an "Intercommunicator" (not a "Intracommunicator"). Knowing this and looking at MPI_Bcast, we see: If comm is an intercommunicator, then the call involves all processes in the intercommunicator, but with one group (group A) defining the root process. All processes in the other group (group B) pass the same value in argument root, which is the rank of the root in group A. The root passes the value MPI_ROOT in root. All other processes in group A pass the value MPI_PROC_NULL in root. Data is broadcast from the root to all processes in group B. The receive buffer arguments of the processes in group B must be consistent with the send buffer argument of the root.This means that you need only replace the broadcast call in the parent with:A few other bugs:The check on the number of arguments should be argc &gt; 1.MPI_Comm_size(intercomm, &amp;size) will return 1. You'll want to use MPI_Comm_remote_size(intercomm, &amp;size) instead.

I want the div.proj that is within 200 pixels of the top of the window to have a class .focused, and otherwise, if it isn't near the top, to have the class .default. The problem I'm having is singling out the one element.This is where I am at this point, but it finds all elements .proj instead of just the one that I'm looking for. This is what I have so far, which isn't really working at all at this point.

For singling out a single element, it will work if your elements are of height >= 200px.If not you should tell us which is the criterion to "single out" a single element (f.ex. the topmost?)In the example the widths are not 100% but the concept is clear I hopeCheck JSFiddle at: Check also 2/ for a different approach that uses 100% width and checks range between 0 and 200px.

12105683	Adding to your .htaccess might work.

12107549	I am using Cassandra 0.8 with 2 secondary indexes for columns like "DeviceID" and "DayOfYear". I have these two indexes in order to retrieve data for a device within a range of dates. Whenever I get a date filter, I convert this into DayOfYear and search using indexed slices using .net Thrift API. Currently I cannot upgrade the DB as well.My problem is I usually do not have any issues retrieving rows using the get_indexed_slices query for the current date (using current day of year). But whenever I query for yesterday's day of year (which is one of the indexed column), I get a time out for the first time I make the query. And most of the times, it returns when I query the second time and 100% during the third time.Both these columns are created as double data type in the column family and I generally get 1 record per minute. I have 3 nodes in the cluster and the nodetool reports suggest that the nodes are up and running, though the load distribution report from nodetool looks like this.Starting NodeToolAddress DC Rack Status State Load Ownsxxx.xx.xxx.xx datacenter1 rack1 Up Normal 7.59 GB 51.39%xxx.xx.xxx.xx datacenter1 rack1 Up Normal 394.24 MB 3.81%xxx.xx.xxx.xx datacenter1 rack1 Up Normal 4.42 GB 44.80%and my configuration in YAML is as below.hinted_handoff_enabled: truemax_hint_window_in_ms: 3600000 # one hourhinted_handoff_throttle_delay_in_ms: 50partitioner: org.apache.cassandra.dht.RandomPartitionercommitlog_sync: periodiccommitlog_sync_period_in_ms: 120000flush_largest_memtables_at: 0.75reduce_cache_sizes_at: 0.85reduce_cache_capacity_to: 0.6concurrent_reads: 32concurrent_writes: 24sliced_buffer_size_in_kb: 64rpc_keepalive: truerpc_server_type: syncthrift_framed_transport_size_in_mb: 15thrift_max_message_length_in_mb: 16incremental_backups: truesnapshot_before_compaction: falsecolumn_index_size_in_kb: 64in_memory_compaction_limit_in_mb: 64multithreaded_compaction: falsecompaction_throughput_mb_per_sec: 16compaction_preheat_key_cache: truerpc_timeout_in_ms: 50000index_interval: 128Is there something I may be missing?

12109265	Duplicate your data in another column family where the key is your search data. Row slice are mutch fasterPersonally I never got to use secondary index in production environments. Or I had problems with timeout, or the speed of data retrieve by secondary index was lower that the amount of data inserted. I think that it is related with not sequentially reading data and HD seek time.
12109536	I've got a class written in Java and the same class written in C#. I'm serializing the C# class into a json string and I am trying to deserialize it on the Java side. It all went perfectly fine until I've added a byte[] field to both classes.here are the classes definitions:C#:Java:The serialization on the C# side uses: request.ToJson() (Json.NET)and the Java deserialization uses: RegisterRequest rr = gsonObject.fromJson(msg, RegisterRequest.class); (using Gson. the msg is the json string)When I don't send anything in the byte array it still works. But when I do fill the array I get an exception on the Java side: com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was STRING at line 1 column 159089I'm guessing that there needs to be something that marks the begining of an array which Gson identifies but Json.NET doesn't adds to the string?
12110007	Ok, this is a cool question - I am going to go ahead and try and answer this because the comments are getting very long.Firstly, the problem is your parser when you are reading the data. It gets tricked up on the binary payload and encounters an illegal character exception. This is because it is trying to deal with a big ByteArray, but encounters a character or byte it can't deal with (probably because there is a byte in the binary that cannot be converted to UTF-8. Also, remember that characters are usually 1 byte in C# and 2 bytes in java as well.There are 2 reasons that I think could be the cause of this. The gson reader is not picking up on the "byte[]" type that you are sending, and it is treating your binary as a UTF-8 encoded string.JSON.NET byte arrays, are not interpreted the same way as that of gson - so it wont work without writing a JSON.NET compatible deserializerI think you need to keep looking at the data, try changing encodings and also, see if you can get a gson parser for java that gives you more control then this one does :)
12110364	I have written some C# programs that read from Excel files and output Excel files. However, I have noticed that at the end of the day I have a LOT of Excel processes still running after the programs have terminated and all files have been closed. Here is how I am handling the file creation and closing:Am I missing something? Any advice is appreciated.Regards.
12110606	Try this code:insted xlApp.Quit(); put xlApp.Exit();I hope it's help you to resolve it.
12110622	Your code is not releasing all COM references (e.g. xlApp.Workbooks.Add creates a reference to a Workbooks object that is never released). Therefore the Excel instance does not close, as described in this KB article, and discussed at length in numerous StackOverflow questions.The Excel instances will eventually shut down after your process has terminated, when COM detects that there hasn't been a ping from the client for a while.
12115155	Given the piece of input from a comment aboveand looking at how Gson serializes byte[]the answer is obvious: Gson uses a json array while json.net uses a json string. You must change one or the other. Writing a custom serializer for gson is easy (although I've never tried with byte[]), the same probably holds for the other tool.
12119814	Though this is not the exact answer , see if this helps you. I use netbeans and to make code indented I simply right click and Format the code. If you are using any other IDE search for similar functionality or may be you can import with help of 3rd party plugins.

12125028	I think that your problem may be caused by the print. The xlrd returns utf8. Depending of the encoding of your console, the print may have difficulties to print it correctly.

12134049	I have made a Rails 3 App with Aptana Studio. This application is already in Github. I tried engine yard to deploy my app. You should specify to engine yard which is the address from your code in github and automatically he make a copy in your server instance.Here is my problem.... The client asked to deploy the app with heroku. I would like to use the code which i have in github and deploy it in heroku.Which is the fastest way to make an heroku app using my code in github? Heroku can take the code from github? Which is the process to follow?I read the quick start from heroku with rails but they suggest to make a new app and copy file by file in the new heroku app.Thanks all!
12134160	Heroku documentation cover this topic in quite length:https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails3Re: MySQL, while you don't have MySQL in Heroku, as long you don't use MySQL specific features (most likely if you used ActiveRecord you didn't) then you shouldn't have any problem deploying your application to heroku.As for deployment, Heroku deployment works like pushing changes to GitHub, to deploy your application you push your codebase to it.Will deploy your master branch to Heroku.Of course, for this to work you need:An account on HerokuHave installed Heroku gem (gem install heroku)Have created an application on heroku (see Heroku documentation)From the Heroku devcenter link, you can skip the create an app step and focus on the other details, like database adapter, groups and such.Hope this helps.
12134207	Since you asked for the quikest shortest way, I think that is:Install the heroku gem (gem install heroku) Create a new app on heroku. heroku create-# Note the output and the app name, e.g. "sharp-rock-2853" In your existing local app, $ heroku git:remote -a sharp-rock-2853-# replace sharp-rock-2853 with your heroku app name from step 1 git push heroku master

I tried do it the same way but using RelativeLayout, but I get correct list, buttons were in the bottom, but they overlay the last item of the list. How can I implement this?
12155298	This is because you are using @+id everywhere, wherever you are referring any id. Ex.:Use "@id/" instead.And also, try:android:layout_below="@id/fileManagerList" // Add this attribute in button.

Then when someone clicks on the span with the class of close, it fades out that particular div again. But I'm having a severe problem with the jQuery selectors because I'm really amateur with it. The code that I'm using slides in all the hidden divs with the id of instant_video and that's where the problem persists. All I want to do is slide down only the div inside the article tag which contains the image I clicked on.The code that I'm currently using is as follows:-
12156900	ids must be unique to a page , you are selecting by class ieselecting by id is like this
12156919	First off, it is not permitted to have more than one element with any given id. id attributes have to be unique in the document.The solution to your problem is to give your img elements a class attribute rather than an id, then to use the jQuery's traversal methods (closest and find in this case) to get the relevant element.So, assuming that your img elements have the class shine, you could do this:
12164118	This is a known bug in Firefox, see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193321The bug has had an on-and-off status with several reports; the behavior is non-standard and browser-specific.You can build a work-around for it, but you're stuck with javascript. After much searching, I determined that unless you're running in privileged mode (i.e. your code is in an extension), you cannot directly influence the pseudo-selector states. That means you're left with adding/removing a class name:Try it: If you do have privileged mode, you can use the method that Firebug employs in their CSS Panel, using inIDOMUtils.setContentStateEditHere is specific code for binding cross-browser delegates rather than putting the javascript inline (shown here for demonstration purposes, but generally bad practice)Try it: This uses the element's style rather than a css class, you can swap out the methods as desired.Another way, as suggested by Supr, is to remove and immediately re-add the element from DOM. You can accomplish this using a delegate as well:Try it: Both methods that utilize delegation are better approaches than looping elements -- that way, the script will apply to any a tags added to the page after load (similar to how jQuery's live or on methods work).DocumentationBugzilla entry - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193321Drag and Drop on MDN (ondragend) - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Drag_and_DropinIDOMUtils - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/inIDOMUtils
12171167	We want to update our game to support the iPhone 5.Do we need to upgrade Xcode to v4.5 and use the iOS 6 SDK??
12172084	I know my question will be nominated to be closed immediately upon publishing, but let me tell you that I had been searching the site for a clear cut difference in terms of an example, in Java. Please don't be in a hurry to close the question.I've written the following:Here, 'noOfCust is the data being hidden'. I am not exposing the implementation part by introducing private getNoOfCusts(). So I believe this is encapsulation, because I have bundled all the details in a class and have hidden the data too.Question 1: If this strong encapsulation ? If not, how could I improve it to be strongly encapsulated?Question 2: Abstraction means complete hiding of the implementation. So what I've done above is abstraction?I've posted this question out of frustration because I had given the above explanation to an interviewer, who told me, this is not the correct meaning. P.S: Please answer in terms of above example. I don't want real time examples or assumptions.
12172206	Choosing necessary properties and hiding unwanted details is Abstraction. For e.g. Consider Person. Person has eyes, eyeColor, skinColor properties. But if he goes to Bank, then Bank does his Abstraction and does not consider these Person's properties but it selects name, address, phone_number. This is Abstraction. You misunderstood it.Encapsulation simply means binding object state(properties) and behavior(methods) together. If you are creating class, you are doing encapsulation.From wiki : In object-oriented programming languages such as C++, Object Pascal, or Java, the concept of abstraction has itself become a declarative statement - using the keywords virtual (in C++) or abstract (in Java). After such a declaration, it is the responsibility of the programmer to implement a class to instantiate the object of the declaration.
12172211	Encapsulation in java takes place automatically through objects and methods.You do not need to take care of that .However if you want , you may use different means of concealment to increase your complexity.So, others will be unable to decipher your code.You may use recursive functions and complicated methods and add unnecessary codes.Strong Encapsulation !!

12176478	Event handlers cannot return values because they're called asynchronously*.Your existing hola() function will return immediately and the return statements in the click handlers are only called much later, i.e. when the button is clicked.My approach would be this, using jQuery deferred objects (jQuery 1.6+):If you prefer, instead of returning the opt value you could use def.reject() to indicate "non-acceptance" and then use a .fail handler to register a handler to be called for that condition.

12201197	MXML is far superior than AS3 in terms of GUI layouts. It's faster to write and far, far more flexible (and you can still use AS3 to boot), and generally faster in overall speed, especially since you do not need to bind resize listeners. MXML and AS3 are meant to be used together, just as HTML and JS are.

12202639	It depends.1) In the case if you want just to use some shared functionality (as example the code which does some calculation).I would recommend to move this shared functionality to some standalone class and call it from there.2) In the case if you want to call MainActivity, so MainActivity did something with MainActivity UI, you will have to use Intent (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html), because MainActivity should be resumed first and only after this it can do something with UI.In this case, you may need to add some additional extra's to intent, which will be parsed by MainActivity code (in onCreate or onResume) and call appropriate method.
12202672	Use public key authentication:In the source host run this only once:That's all, after that you'll be able to do ssh without password.
12202896	To get key-exchange to work from a thumbdrive, you have to copy your private key to your drive, and specify it in your ssh command (to avoid using the local accounts private key), e.g.:Alternatively, you could use expect (which is a separate script from shell). Here's a previous question regarding SSH and expect.Note that anyone will be able to open the expect script and see the login credentials in plain text.
12203184	I disagree with @Apocalyptic0n3: HTML and JS are 2 completely different languages, whereas MXML is just a declarative way to write AS. MXML code is compiled to AS first and the generated AS is then compiled to ABC bytecode, just like regular AS.This means that as long as you use the Flex component hierarchy for writing your components in AS there will be hardly any performance difference. And anything you can write in MXML can be written in AS. Some of the generated code may be useless to your specific use case, so there's some optimization that could be done there, but it would hardly be noteicable in most cases. (If you write pure AS components outside the Flex framework, that's a whole other story of course)The main difference is the speed at which you write your code, because you're going to put a lot more time into writing a component in AS as opposed to MXML.In MXML you would also naturally use data bindings, whereas in a component written in AS you would usually set properties by overriding the commitProperties() method. There is a significant performance difference to be made here, but it doesn't mean you can't use bindings in AS, or you can't override commitProperties in an MXML-based component.

This way, you can prevent swapping 1 with 3, or 2 with 4. You can do this repetitively, until the numbers are properly scrambled:[1, 2, 3, 4] random number is 0, swap with element at position 1.[2, 1, 3, 4] random number is 1, swap with element at position 2.elements are 1 and 3, so don't swap.[2, 1, 3, 4] random number is 2, swap with element at position 3.[2, 1, 4, 3] etc.If you'd like to generalize the constraint, you can simply change the condition. Instead of refusing to swap when the elements are either 1 and 3, or 2 and 4 (as in the example above), you could make sure the two elements at the positions to be swapped are not within 2 of each other, so something like if(b==a+2)continue;:elements are 5 and 7, so don't swap.

12274821	I have a multi-threaded batch processing app that runs anywhere between 5-10 concurrent threads of execution. Their data segments are carefully sliced to be as evenly distributed as possible but, of course, the execution times always vary. What I wanna do is to invoke one last kind of onFinalize method when the last thread finishes, which will do some stat computation.I was wondering if the best way to know for a thread that it is the last one (rather than querying the DB, which seems kind of pedestrian) is to have a static var which would be incremented in a synchronized block when a new thread is added and decremented when each thread finishes. So when a thread finishes and does its decrementing, I can have an if to see if the outstanding # of threads is 0 and then invoke the final stats.That is what I was thinking. I was wondering if there is a better, more elegant, or bulletproof way of accomplishing this.Using Java 7Thanks
12275036	So what else you can do is that you can create a ThreadManager class. This class should have a List&lt;Thread&gt;. Whenever you create a new Thread to execute your task you should register it in ThreadManager. Then create a method in ThreadManager which returns the total number of live Threads in the List.In this way you can at any point see how many threads are running and also you can perform any other operation on the running threads if you want. Also one more Thread should run periodically which should clear all dead Thread references from the List.Sample ThreadManager can look like this:Hope this helps. You can perform other functions aswell on the Thread List.

12275329	You will need to check the code for those classes whose objects are memory hungry. Then, implement IDisposable interface in those classes. Next, make sure wherever the objects are created for those classes, they are disposed after use.Simple yet incorrect, IMHO, answer to your first question will be to use static methods from GC class. But be aware that GC spawns across all the .Net applications and not just yours.
12275571	Define a view called vTeam with this definition: SELECT dbo.Team.TeamID, dbo.EMP.EmpName AS Manager, EMP_1.EmpName AS Member, EMP_1.EmpID AS MemberID, dbo.EMP.EmpID AS ManagerID FROM dbo.EMP AS EMP_1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN dbo.Team ON EMP_1.EmpID = dbo.Team.MemberID LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.EMP ON dbo.Team.ManagerID = dbo.EMP.EmpIDThis query will give you your result: SELECT TeamID, Manager, MemberList = STUFF(( SELECT ',' + Member FROM vTeam as xx WHERE xx.TeamID = x.TeamID and x.Manager = xx.Manager FOR XML PATH(''), TYPE).value('.[1]', 'nvarchar(max)'), 1, 1, '') FROM dbo.vTeam AS x GROUP BY TeamID,Manager;Team1 John Alex,TomTeam2 Alex John,Alex,Tom
12276179	Any software that you use would help you identify the problem classes and not with solutions to prevent or solve the issue.Well, to dispose all the objects in a single time, you would need to have a reference to the objects at that particular time. I don't think that is practical.A better solution would be to identify the problem classes and resources which are not getting disposed properly and then, as Danish said, implement the IDisposable interface for them. Then, you can explicitly dispose of the objects after there use is over.Also, you can think of using the 'using' statement with those objects against disposing them, as this would reduce you pain of disposing these objects explicitly and would also result in the timely disposal.You can read more about using the using statement here and here
12281533	I'm looking to solve the following problem:Starting with a collection A, I want to pass some kind of 'view' on that collection (say collection B) to a certain method. The view B does not necessary contain all the elements of the original collection A. If in this method objects are added to or removed from the view (collection B), these changes should also be reflected on the original collection A as well. For instance (pseudo-code):Start situation:Method call:End situation:Does anyone know a neat solution to this problem?
12281591	You could always have two different collections, a collection A and a collection B.Then, whenever you added something to B, you would add it to A, and whenever removed something from B you would also remove it from A.When removing from A you would check whether or not B contained the object to be removed, and, if so, you would remove it.However, when adding to A, you would not touch B.This might be less space efficient than an optimal solution, but it's not going to change time complexity (except for maybe removals from A.)
12281751	One way is to use List.sublist(): Another more general way would be through Guavas Collections2.filter(), that lets you define a predicate to control which objects should be in the view: Both examples print

12300734	You are using the wrong event : ClientClick is just a client side event triggered in javascript.What you want is the Click Event[...]If you still aren't catching the event, then chances are you are declaring your LinkButton dynamically at the wrong time in the Page Lifecycle (as mentionned by Eoin Campbell in his comments and in his answer).He links to an article that's really good on the subject, you should read it to understand why you aren't catching the event. Judging by your comments on your question and on different answers, you are declaring the button in your Page_Load function. That will not work because Page_Load occurs too late in the page lifecycle.From what I understand, right now you have : You need to get rid of that.

12317932	No, Tomcat won't automatically use the system proxy settings.I suggest you look into the facilities provided by java.net.Proxy. This allows you to dynamically specifiy a proxy at runtime. The system properties work but they are only read once, and if Tomcat has already used an HttpURLConnection for its own purposes prior to you setting them that's the end of that: the setting has no effect.

You may have to escape it in addition. This is not the case with standard PostgreSQL clients like psql or pgAdmin.That is all very useful for writing plpgsql functions or ad-hoc SQL commands.

The UIWindow rootViewController documentation states:  If the window has an existing view hierarchy, the old views are removed before the new ones are installed.However I did not find this to be the case... so I remove the existing views myself explicitly before assigning a new rootViewController.

12358272	Java allows anonymous (unnamed) classes. What's more, they can extend another class. When used in this fashion, they are similar to blocks in Objective C.You'll often see an anonymous class defined which implements Runnable or similar. This is doing something similar to blocks: providing an anonymous, in-line definition of code that is passed somewhere for later use.For more info, see the example here: So in Java you could write something like the following:The method doMyThing could at a later point call the run method (or spawn it as a thread by passing your Runnable into a new Thread object, etc.)There's further discussion here:Limitations of Java Anonymous Classes compared to Objective-C Blocks)
12368302	Is it crucial for performance to have ViewHolder as static in a ViewHolder pattern? A ViewHolder object stores each of the component views inside the tag field of the Layout, so you can immediately access them without the need to look them up repeatedly. First, you need to create a class to hold your exact set of views. For example:
12368442	It's not crucial for performance, it is about using. If ViewHolder class will not be static - you have to provide instance of parent class:
12368513	It's not mandatory to do that. But when you use to do like this, you are using the views again when your adapter view is null. You are creating a view and assigning values to the view part, and tag the whole view using static class ViewHolder. So when you come back and view is not null, then visible part will come from to get the tag. This is how you will create less object as well less work load on adapter.

12370171	This is really the nicest way of doing it. You could unset the $_GET['act'] variable so it doesn't affect the rest of the control flow, or just render the rest of the page like normal (i.e. you don't need the redirect, just render the rest of the page as if the $_GET['act'] variable was never set).

You can store it in many ways, including structured or unstructured formats such as XML, CSV, etc. If you don't want the user to be able to read the content, you can encrypt it in some way. You can also choose to use a local database type, such as SQLCE or SQLLite, which could provide the security you may be looking for.

After testing, I realized that this can works if the file is being run (as __main__, but not if it's being imported, which is very unreliable).I think the best thing you could do is not name your file with a name that is used by a std lib package.
12396775	Imported files are cached in sys.modules, and any attempt to import another module with the same name will simply return the cached module.

Caveat Emptor.Of course after that you'll have to find a way to modify the path so that the proper file gets imported.My overall advice is to prevent the situation altogether and rename your file so that there's no conflict.

Rather than passing expressions into the for-loop parameters, all that was written was two semi-colons.I understand that a for-loop normally contains 3 expressions separated by semi-colons. So this is clearly just running a for-loop with no expressions and relying on a break (Line 6) to exit the loop.What I want to know is, does this method have a performance advantage over the traditional method? The way I see it, this could have been easily rewritten as a while loop like so:

12416426	This is more geared toward MonoTouch, but the same techniques apply to Obj-C:Basically the Default-568h@2x.png file will tell iOS that it's a 'Tall' app. For other image assets you need to detect if it's the tall device or not by checking the UIScreen's MainScreen's Bounds as well as if it's an iPhone idiom or not and then seeing if the height is 1136 (checking the scale value), and then selecting a different sized image in this case.Here's the C# code, but again it's very close to Obj-C:
12418011	[edit]Apple is now explicitly rejecting applications submitted with the iOS 5.x SDK and iPhone 5 default images, saying "Your app contains a launch image with a size modifier that is only supported for apps built with the iOS 6.0 SDK or later."Old answer :Yes you can use Xcode 4.4 or below to support iPhone 5. The iOS (6) will run an app in letterbox mode if there is not a 640x1136 splashscreen image in your resources. The image must be called Default-568h@2x.png (if your splashscreen is Default.png in your Info.plist).So just add this image on your Xcode project whatever version it is, and the app will run in full screen mode.This being said, there are chances that Apple will not let you install an app compiled with Xcode 4.4 or below on an iOS 6 device (and of course no iPhone 5 simulator for Xcode 4.4 and below). [edit] As told in the comments, yes, you can install on an iPhone 5 / iOS6 with Xcode4.4.
12418146	I am making a app and part of it needs to display an image. Instead of have the app download the image, I want to just show it in a UIWebView. I have added the WebView to the app and given it the URL to the image and told it to load, however it stays as a white screen. I even tried to get it to load www.google.com and it still wouldn't load.Can anyone help me with this? Here is how everything I'm doing to the web view.The webView is declared as follows in the .h file:And it is synthesised in the .m file.
12418397	If you're using a storyboard, the file owner is still there but it's called View Controller. So to link the UIWebView in the storyboard to the UIWebView outlet, you hold down control, then click and drag a line from the View Controller to the Web View. This is all in the 'View Controller Scene' panel to the left of the storyboard.  Note that when you first create your project from the Single View Application template, there's no need to leave the 'Use Storyboard' checkbox ticked. You might find it easier to follow these older tutorials if you don't use a storyboard.  By the way, another important checkbox, just under 'Use Storyboard', is 'Use Automatic Reference Counting'. This is a great feature, but if you have it turned on while you're following the tutorial you've linked to, you'll need to skip the part where he releases the webView instance variable.Copied from

12433947	I'm porting a C project from Linux to Windows. On Linux it is completely stable. On Windows, it's working well most times, but sometimes I got a segmentation fault.I'm using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 to compile and debug and looks like sometimes my malloc calls simply doesn't allocate memory, returning NULL. The machine has free memory; it already passed through that code a thousand times, but it still happens in different locations.Like I said, it doesn't happen all the time or in the same location; it looks like a random error.Is there something I have to be more careful on Windows than on Linux? What can I be doing wrong?
12434865	malloc() returns an invalid pointer of NULL when it is unable to service a memory request. In most cases the C memory allocation routines manage a list or heap of memory available memory with calls to the operating system to allocate additional chunks of memory when a malloc() call is made and there is not a block on the list or heap to satisfy the request.So the first case of malloc() failing is when the memory request can not be satisfied because there is not a usable block of memory on the list or heap and when the C runtime memory management requested more memory from the operating system, the request was refused.Here is an article about Pointer Allocation Strategies.This forum article gives an example of malloc failure due to memory fragmentation.Another reason why malloc() might fail is because the memory management data structures have become corrupted probably due to a buffer overflow. Different versions of malloc() can use different strategies for memory management and determining how much memory to provide when malloc() is called. For instance a malloc() may give you exactly the number of bytes requested or it may give you more than you asked for in order to fit the block allocated within memory boundaries or to make the memory management easier.With modern operating systems and virtual memory, it is pretty difficult to run out of memory unless you are doing some really large memory resident storage.A good run time memory management will try to coalesce freed chunks of memory so that many smaller blocks will be combined into larger blocks as they are freed. This combining of chunks of memory reduces the chances of being unable to service a memory request using what is already available on the list or heap of memory being managed by the C memory management run time.The more that you can just reuse already allocated memory and the less you depend on malloc() and free() the better. If you are not doing a malloc() then it is difficult for it to fail.The more that you can change many small size calls to malloc() to fewer large calls to malloc() the less chance you have for fragmenting the memory and expanding the size of the memory list or heap with lots of small blocks that can not be combined because they are not next to each other.The more that you can malloc() and free() contiguous blocks at the same time, the more likely that the memory management run time can coalesce blocks.There is no rule that says you must do a malloc() with a specific size. So you may want to use some kind of a rule for calls to malloc () so that standard sized blocks are allocated so that you allocate in blocks of 16 bytes using a formula like ((size / 16) + 1) * 16 or more likely ((size >> 4) + 1) &lt;&lt; 4. Many script languages use something similar so as to increase the chance of repeated calls to malloc() and free() being able to match up a request with a free block on the list or heap of memory.Here is a somewhat simple example of trying to reduce the number of blocks allocated and deallocated. Lets say that we have a linked list of variable sized blocks of memory. So the struct for the nodes in the linked list look something like:There could be two ways of allocating this memory for a particular buffer and its node. The first is a standard allocation of the node followed by an allocation of the buffer as in the following.However another way would be to do something like the following which uses a single memory allocation with pointer arithmetic so that a single malloc() provides both memory areas.However if you are using this single allocation method, you will need to make sure that you are consistent in the use of the pointer pMegaBuffer that you do not accidently do a free() on it. And if you are having to change out the buffer with a larger buffer, you will need to free the node and reallocate buffer and node. So there is more work for the programmer.

12436465	Please clarify one thing here nick. Can you tell me whether you want to just make the color of the second row to red. If that is the case you can iterate through the list view and then keep a count variable on the top and then when the count == 1 then you can change the list view.background color to red. if you have tried this then can you tell me what happened. Does it ended with error or something or nothing happened.

Works great.I want to add the passing of arrays and non array data back and forth and after reading piles of articles saying json IS the way to go!!!! BUT... also that json isn't secure, ... put braces, dont put braces - use json decode, dont use it, make sure the top item is an object, some say put a "d" at the top, some use serialization, some don't use it. Do I have to put the curley braces around the data? Or does Jquery. Some people have said to also add a header that specifies application/json or some other header... and others have said it breaks IE7... some have said to add ..."dataType" : jsonin the ajax call. Do you see why I am confused now?... and ... In the PHP do I have to also use rawurldecode? before json decode since my ajax urlencodes the data ... it's sooo confusing...I don't want this to be a bigger security hole than it already is... I would like to do it PROPERLY and to SPEC. if there is a spec.Most people thankfully say... it's about HOW you use it (jquery, JSON) etc and THAT makes it "secure". And by secure... I mean, used properly. Nothing on the client side is EVER secure.What I'm stuck on is simple I'm sure but after reading for over 9+ hours I can't find a definitive answer. Why can't the people who make the languages (Jquery) write an example that says... here's the PROPER way to do it now that we have included json support!?!And yes, I'm being a tad wordy in this top portion because I've asked short questions before and been downvoted and criticized and accused of not researching things or not "looking into it enough" when I NEVER ask a question here without at least 5+ hours of intense reading, scanning websites, etc.. and usually I only come here after way over 9+ hours ... ...but the information I have found is broken, old, and in too many pieces and I want to do it PERFECTLY!!! :) The best website I found so far was for pulling in flicker pictures but it didn't show how to send properly so I left there happy to find the article... but didn't know how to apply it to MY situation...Please see the comments in my code for the tips I need please or even better - fix up my code so I can send those 2 datas back and forth and in each language can you assign a value to a tmp variable so I can SEE how you extract the information from the passed data? Thanks...JQUERY/JS (my old code) (code snippits)PHP RECEIVE FROM AJAX (my old test code)PHP RETURNMore info on my stuff...my website is UTF-8 encodedMy data set will be under 4 megs.

12440362	This problem is "real" in that previous posters have shown a real difference in appearance in Apple's Mountain Lion operating system.But the scroll behavior still works, in other examples I see on the internet and on the "Test this" link of the opening post.The problem is that the default user setup in Mountain Lion causes the scroll bars to be hidden so the user does not see them. And the default "natural" scroll wheel or track pad (Magic Pad) direction is opposite of older systems or PC's. These two aspects lead to confusion.With the default settings, the scrolling region will scroll if the mouse arrow is over the block (even though the scroll bars are not present), and will appear if one moves in the proper direction. The default "natural" (as Apple calls it) direction is that the scroll wheel or the track pad moves the object itself in the "natural" direction (as opposed to the window moving on the object). There is a setting on the Mac to reverse this, but that will make the Mac's direction opposite of the direction on Apple's touch tablets.The real problem is the confusion to the user caused by the hiding of the scroll bars, so they don't realize that they CAN move the area with a scroll wheel if mouse cursor is over. And furthermore the user must have a track pad or scroll wheel for it to even work, but that is needed for the most part to even navigate the Mountain Lion operating system itself. The user can change the Mac's setting in the Personal General setting to "Show scroll bars: Always". But that is of little help to the CSS or website developer.I suggest we complain to Apple about this. Main alternative is just not use the feature of scrollable area in a window of a website.
12442718	There is no need to send data as JSON, it would mean to include other libraries for nothing. You can use jQuery to send data as array, and read it as array in your PHP script.Eg:Returning a single var from PHP:and your script:Returning the data to jQuery as array and other single variables.You add dataType: "json" and return data as JSON:and script:

12444723	In my class, I have a member variable std::vector&lt;node*&gt; childrenDoes the following class member function create a memory leak?The vector makes a copy of the pointer and I have two pointers to the same memory,and then the original pointer goes out of scope, right? This may be simple and obvious, but I would just like to confirm my assumption.thanks
12444763	Assuming children is a class member you would just simply delete all the items in the vector on the class deconstructor.If you used a vector&lt;Foo&gt;child instead, every push_back on the vector would create a copy of the original object to be stored, but since you're using pointers, in this case allocated on the heap by new no object copy is created, the pointer that points to a long-life term object is simply stored, meaning yes, you have to delete it later.
12444779	It's not a leak ... yet. However, if the vector goes out of scope, or you erase, pop_back or do something else that removes elements from the vector, without first deleteing the element that you're removing you'll have a leak on your hands.The right way to do this is to change from using a vector&lt;node *&gt; to vector&lt;unique_ptr&lt;node&gt;&gt;. Your code will change toOr use boost::ptr_vector&lt;node&gt; if you can use Boost.

12446791	The type of "copy me" is char const[8], which decays to char const *. Since the default constructor is not explicit, "copy me" can be implicitly converted to B, and thus ob can be copy-constructed from that implicitly converted, temporary B-object.Had the default constructor been declared explicit, you would have had to write one of the following:Had the copy constructor also been declared explicit, you would have had to say one of these:In practice, all copies will be elided by any half-decent compiler, and you always end up with a single default constructor invocation.
12446931	Edit: after discussion with Kerrek SB I got a copy of the C++11 standard. I was wrong, there's a temporary. I'm editing this reply to reflect my newly acquired understanding.15 years ago I knew C++ extremely well (that was around the time the first standard was to be released). I haven't used it since late 1998 so I have forgotten a lot and I know almost nothing of the recent standards. The code is correct. There's no error. This is parsed as a declaration of an initialized variable. B is the type, ob the name of the variable, "copy me" the initializer.The initializer is of type const char* and there is, in class B, a constructor that takes a const char* typed single argument. That constructor is not declared restricted by explicit and therefore can be used in this context.Either a temporary object is created and then copied (you see both lines printed out) or the copy is elided and only the conversion constructor is called to construct directly at the destination (you see only one line printed). The standard explicitly allows this even if the copy constructor has side effects.The program execution will print Constructor called to stdout. It may or may not then also print Copy constructor called. There is no error.
12449377	I've been trying to learn the use of "if" and "for" in R. As a simple example I set up the data frameMy goal was to set up an if statement that would remove a column in a row based on a row value. As an example:so according to these rules my data frame would end up looking like thisMy first thought was I could write a simple if statement to do this:But I got an error that "if" conditional statements can not be >1. So I thought if I wrote a "for" loop, it would allow the if statement to go row by row, allowing the conditional statement to be ==1.But now I get the same error, just x10. So I'm obviously barking up the same tree. So my question would be- what is the best way to deal with my original data frame question? And if not with some sort of if or for loop answer, why do I get this error?
12449468	This isn't going to help you use if because you shouldn't use if here but vectorize the solution. Also you really can't just put holes in a data frame because by definition a data frame is a list of equal length vectors. I suppose you could make it into a character vector and replace the pieces you want with "" but that probably isn't useful. Another approach is to use print and print it as a matrix and tell it not to show NAs or missing values. Long story short:vectorize replace with NA not blank to print NAs as blank turn it to a matrix and use arguments for the print functionHere it is...
12449489	Ok, without digging too much in details, I think you should use a for to iterate over the data frame, and an if to perform the deletion. On the other hand, you cant have a data frame with different row sizes, so it would make more sense to replace the desired entries with NaN:When you run this script you get the following output:Just in case, there's an excelent R reference site I use: statmethods.netHope this helps you

12454794	IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; is co-variant but it does not support value type, just only reference type. The below simple code is compiled successfully:But changing from string to int will get compiled error:The reason is explained in MSDN: Variance applies only to reference types; if you specify a value type for a variant type parameter, that type parameter is invariant for the resulting constructed type.I have searched and found that some questions mentioned the reason is boxing between value type and reference type. But it does not still clear up my mind much why boxing is the reason?Could someone please give a simple and detailed explanation why covariance and contravariance do not support value type and how boxing affects this?
12454932	Basically, variance applies when the CLR can ensure that it doesn't need to make any representational change to the values. References all look the same - so you can use an IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; as an IEnumerable&lt;object&gt; without any change in representation; the native code itself doesn't need to know what you're doing with the values at all, so long as the infrastructure has guaranteed that it will definitely be valid.For value types, that doesn't work - to treat an IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; as an IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;, the code using the sequence would have to know whether to perform a boxing conversion or not.You might want to read Eric Lippert's blog post on representation and identity for more on this topic in general.EDIT: Having reread Eric's blog post myself, it's at least as much about identity as representation, although the two are linked. In particular: This is why covariant and contravariant conversions of interface and delegate types require that all varying type arguments be of reference types. To ensure that a variant reference conversion is always identity-preserving, all of the conversions involving type arguments must also be identity-preserving. The easiest way to ensure that all the non-trivial conversions on type arguments are identity-preserving is to restrict them to be reference conversions.

I am having the hard time to follow the instructions. They do not work for me.On MacOS I open the terminal and put these in:export LUA_DIR=/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/lua/5.1 (it tells me, mkdir: illegal option) and I can not follow from hereSET LUA_DIR=”c:\program files\lua\5.1”As for Windows I do this according to the book.This what I see in my shell c:\Users\bd&gt;mkdir "c:\program files\utility" and it tells me access is denied I have tried to right click on this folder and check off read only, but it does not work.Any clues would be appreciated, this part has been really confusing for me.
12463948	You can use the Javascript window.location function. store the values of the textbox into variable
12464623	To package your Lua files into an executable on Windows you have several options. There is srlua, there is wxLuaFreeze from wxLua (available as a binary for Windows), and there are more options in this SO answer.Essentially, the main two options are: (1) append your Lua code to a precompiled exe file, such that it will be loaded and executed when that exe file is run, and (2) convert your Lua code into real executable by compiling it to bytecode, then to C, and then to your target platform.As to your MacOS issue, mkdir -p means that mkdir is asked to create intermediate directories (for example, you asked to create /a/b/c, it will also create /a/b if those don't exist). As you don't say which version of MacOS you run, it's difficult to provide more detailed answer.
12464706	So, if I understood your question correctly, you are trying to build Lua on Windows.This is of course possible, but not easy for beginners. I would highly recommend you to use a binary distribution, which is much easier to install, unless you have special requirements.Here are several Windows distributions :Lua Binaries (Lua 5.1 and 5.2)LuaForWindows (Lua 5.1)LuaDist (Lua 5.2)

If I put it in a resource file, it appears that it is trivial for another app to be able to browse and read that file simply by using PackageManager.getResourcesForApplication().Where is the correct place to put information like this that we don't want people to be able to easily snoop?Should it be in a compiled java file? Or are classfiles also easily readable? Also, if they're in java files, is it possible to reference them from XML files that need them (eg. for the google maps api key)?

Of course, if the potential gain substantiates the effort. Otherwise, security by obscurity, such as obfuscation, may be the way to go.Handling real secrets should be based on some sort of input, notably passwords.Happily, API keys, if used as they are supposed to, are not necessarily a real secret.
12465670	if you just want to deny access to your data from other applications, you can use SharedPreferences. Just use  Contex.getSharedPreferences(/prefs file name/, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);According to documentation MODE_PRIVATE means that the created file can only be accessed by the calling application (or all applications sharing the same user ID).

12481588	Faster might not be the best criterion for deciding what to do.I'll bet your friend has no data to support or refute either recommendation.Isn't a JavaScript import a network hop, just like a call to the database? I'd compromise: put them in MySQL, load them into memory on startup, and cache them in the middle tier. You'll only pay for the network hop to GET them from the middle tier to the browser and the data will be in a real database.If you don't have a middle tier, then you're out of luck.Does every user need all the values in that table, or just a few?

12483864	Sure, it's easy:Say b has any bits set, the least significant is bit number k. Then b-1 has the same bits as b for indices above k, a 0-bit in place k and 1-bits in the less significant places, so the bitwise and removes the least significant set bit from b. If b had only one bit set, the result becomes 0, if b had more bits set, the result is nonzero.
12483898	This may be a bit naive, but I'd loop from 0 to 63, clear the relevant bit, and see if the result is 0:it's nowhere near as clever as the other posted answers, but it has the advantage of being easy to understand.

12498905	You could use  it ports a bunch of PHP functionality to javascript, but if it's just echos, and the script is in a php file, you could do something like this:don't worry about the shifty-looking use of double-quotes, PHP will render that before the browser sees it.as for using ajax, the easiest way is to use a library, like jQuery. With that you can do:and test.php would be:it would write the contents of test.php to whatever element has the result class.

12500554	It may be not the right answer, but, remember that Int32 it's an class type, and int is a primitive type. For the compiler they are not the same type. In some cases, the compiler allows to make a hidden or implicit conversion, that is not visible to the programmer.And, the same goes for String class type and string primitive type.I still prefer to mention "reference (s)" as "object (s)", and "value (s)" as "primitive type (s)".Altought, the compiler implicitly changes many stuff to an Object, you may want to explictly use the Object &amp; Class version of the data you want to use.A U.R.L. with the .Net ECMA specification for "primitive types":Another question covering similar topic:What is the difference between INT, INT16, INT32 and INT64?EDIT: Changed capitalized "Integer" to "Int32".
12508225	Is there a way to update the URL programatically without reloading the page?EDIT: I added something in the title in post .I just want to make it clear that I don't want to reload the page
12508242	Yes - document.location = "http://my.new.url.com"You can also retrieve it the same way eg. The location object has a number of useful properties too:EDIT: Setting the hash of the document.location shouldn't reload the page, just alter where on the page the focus is. So updating to #myId will scroll to the element with id="myId". If the id doesn't exist I believe nothing will happen? (Need to confirm on various browsers though)EDIT2: To make it clear, not just in a comment:You can't update the whole URL with javascript without changing the page, this is a security restriction. Otherwise you could click on a link to a random page, crafted to look like gmail, and instantly change the URL to www.gmail.com and steal people's login details. You can change the part after the domain on some browsers to cope with AJAX style things, but that's already been linked to by Osiris. What's more, you probably shouldn't do this, even if you could. The URL tells the user where he/she is on your site. If you change it without changing the page contents, it's becomes a little confusing.
12508290	Plain javascript: document.location = 'http://www.google.com';This will cause a browser refresh though - consider using hashes if you're in need of having the URL updated to implement some kind of browsing history without reloading the page. You might want to look into jQuery.hashchange if this is the case.
12509432	I have a very simple query. However it contains a LIKE clause which is searching a largish text field.I know the table only has (for example) 200200 rows (I'm only interested in finding something that happened in a row id > 200000). I tried to optimise the query by adding inmy thinking was that SQL would run the ID &gt; 200000 constraint first and that would help speed up the query, but it still takes minutes to run, what should I do to make this run faster. EDIT:ID is PK and indexed
12509521	You could try to create a temp-table with only the entries with an id > 200000, and query that to see if it makes any difference:
12509524	Very short answer ;-) Add an index to the columns.
12514989	There are many articles the web about Responsive Design, and how to use css media queries to accomplish your goals. However the majority of them seem to have been written in 2011, when responsive design began to get popular.Since 2011, a lot of different devices have been released to the market with a large variety of device widths and various ppi's the media queries of 2011 aren't necessarily going to cover. Mostly I'm referring to large format mobile devices like the Galaxy Note I/II as well as 7" tablets and even high ppi devices like retina displays.Are there any resources out there that maintain up-to-date css media query code that would be used in a best-practice approach to covering most devices adequately?

12533640	I was wondering if controllers at CakePHP should not contain any private function which is not accessible by URL.Sometimes some functions such as add or delete can be so large that I prefer to divide them. Should I put that functions inside the model instead of making then private on the Controller?Thanks.
12533674	No. CakePHP is a framework, feel free to create private functions for reusable bits of logic. It's probably encouraged.
12534740	Yeah it's probably for the best if you keep your methods in the Model. Like you yourself have mentioned in the comment, "keep models fat and controllers thin".. The controller is just an medium which is supposed to interact between model and view. The problem comes when you have to deal with change in datasources, tables. If your controllers are fat, you would have used the fields everywhere, now you will be left with cleaning the whole setup, in a place where it wasn't supposed to be.The added benefit of methods in models is that you can call it from other models and REUSE the code. for exampleThe above method can be accessed by every other methods in both model and controller which is related to the User. If you need such functions elsewhere and if you don't have them defined in the User model, you will either end up redirecting it to the controller or write the whole logic all over again. The redirecting thing isn't that bad but consider if u have rewritten the logic elsewhere and if your implementation of ActiveUsers changes, u will end up correcting everywhere.However, there are few things that has to be done in controller. For example, if i have to calculate the distance between the user's geolocation and all the matching restaurants for a nearby distance I should do this in the controller. But it is in the best of interest the controller are left thin, for this purpose there exists components. You can create your custom components for complex and lengthy logic.

12541439	The whole point of MVC is to break down the logic. I cant say what is wrong with keeping all logic in app.js in the question. But after looking at various examples, I learned that app.js is a short file, not a big one. Move the logic part to various other files(Controller logic to controller.js and all) and try again.One example I can point out quickly is that the following codeis supposed to be in view.js. This is what MVC means. Hope it answers your question.
12543341	I put your C++ function into header file as an inline function for testing.I was then able to construct a SWIG interface that does what you are looking for. It has two key parts. Firstly I wrote a typemap that will allow either a std::map, or a perl hash to be given as input to C++ functions that expect a std::map. In the case of the latter it builds a temporary map from the perl hash to use as the argument. (Which is convenient but potentially slow). The typemap picks the correct behaviour by checking what it was actually passed in.The second part of the solution is to map some of the C++ map's member functions onto the special functions that perl uses for overloading operations on hashes. Most of these are implemented simply with %rename where the C++ function and perl functions are compatible however FIRSTKEY and NEXTKEY don't map well onto C++'s iterators, so these were implemented using %extend and (internally) another std::map to store the iteration state of the maps we're wrapping.There are no special typemaps implemented here for returning the maps, however there is extra behaviour via the special operations that are now implemented.The SWIG interface looks like:%module stl%include &lt;std_string.i&gt;%include &lt;exception.i&gt;%rename(FETCH) std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;::get;%rename(STORE) std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;::set;%rename(EXISTS) std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;::has_key;%rename(DELETE) std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;::del;%rename(SCALAR) std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;::size;%rename(CLEAR) std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;::clear;%{#include &lt;map&gt;#include &lt;string&gt;// For iteration support, will leak if iteration stops before the end ever.static std::map&lt;void*, std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;::const_iterator&gt; iterstate;const char *current(std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;&amp; map) { std::map&lt;void*, std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;::const_iterator&gt;::iterator it = iterstate.find(&amp;map); if (it != iterstate.end() &amp;&amp; map.end() == it-&gt;second) { // clean up entry in the global map iterstate.erase(it); it = iterstate.end(); } if (it == iterstate.end()) return NULL; else return it-&gt;second-&gt;first.c_str();}%}%extend std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; { std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; *TIEHASH() { return $self; } const char *FIRSTKEY() { iterstate[$self] = $self-&gt;begin(); return current(*$self); } const char *NEXTKEY(const std::string&amp;) { ++iterstate[$self]; return current(*$self); }}%include &lt;std_map.i&gt;%typemap(in,noblock=1) const std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;&amp; (void *argp=0, int res=0, $1_ltype tempmap=0) { res = SWIG_ConvertPtr($input, &amp;argp, $descriptor, %convertptr_flags); if (!SWIG_IsOK(res)) { if (SvROK($input) &amp;&amp; SvTYPE(SvRV($input)) == SVt_PVHV) { fprintf(stderr, "Convert HV to map\n"); tempmap = new $1_basetype; HV *hv = (HV*)SvRV($input); HE *hentry; hv_iterinit(hv); while ((hentry = hv_iternext(hv))) { std::string *val=0; // TODO: handle errors here SWIG_AsPtr_std_string SWIG_PERL_CALL_ARGS_2(HeVAL(hentry), &amp;val); fprintf(stderr, "%s =&gt; %s\n", HeKEY(hentry), val-&gt;c_str()); (*tempmap)[HeKEY(hentry)] = *val; delete val; } argp = tempmap; } else { %argument_fail(res, "$type", $symname, $argnum);  } } if (!argp) { %argument_nullref("$type", $symname, $argnum); } $1 = %reinterpret_cast(argp, $ltype);}%typemap(freearg,noblock=1) const std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;&amp; { delete tempmap$argnum;}%template(StringStringMap) std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;;%{#include "stl.h"%}%include "stl.h"I then adapted your sample perl to test:use Data::Dumper;use stl;my $v = stl::TryMap(stl::StringStringMap-&gt;new());$v-&gt;{'a'} = '1';print Dumper $v;print Dumper stl::TryMap({'a' =&gt; '4'});print Dumper stl::TryMap($v);foreach my $key (keys %{$v}) { print "$key =&gt; $v-&gt;{$key}\n";}print $v-&gt;{'7'}."\n";Which I was able to run successfully:Got map: 0x22bfb80$VAR1 = bless( { '7' =&gt; '!', 'a' =&gt; '1' }, 'stl::StringStringMap' );Convert HV to mapa =&gt; 4Got map: 0x22af710In C++ map: a =&gt; 4$VAR1 = bless( { '7' =&gt; '!', 'a' =&gt; '4' }, 'stl::StringStringMap' );Got map: 0x22bfb20In C++ map: 7 =&gt; !In C++ map: a =&gt; 1$VAR1 = bless( { '7' =&gt; '!', 'a' =&gt; '1' }, 'stl::StringStringMap' );7 =&gt; !a =&gt; 1!You can also tie this object to a hash, for example:use stl;my $v = stl::TryMap(stl::StringStringMap-&gt;new());print "$v\n";tie %foo, "stl::StringStringMap", $v;print $foo{'a'}."\n";print tied(%foo)."\n";In theory you can write an out typemap to set up this tie automatically on return from every function call, but so far I've not succeeded in writing a typemap that works with both the tying and the SWIG runtime type system.It should be noted that this isn't production ready code. There's a thread safety issue for the internal map and some error handling missing too that I know of. I've also not fully tested all of hash operations work from the perl side beyond what you see above. It would also be nice to make it more generic, by interacting with the swig_map_common macro. Finally I'm not a perl guru by any means and I've not used the C API much so some caution in that area would be in order.

I can't just use $(document).ajaxStart($.blockUI).ajaxStop($.unblockUI);My code is the following..The scenario is that when I click the .submit button, the page is blocked and a ajax call is made to the server to get a data response. When the ajax call is successful, I unblock the current page and if data.status is 'OK', I show a message box (also based on blockUI plugin). Else I show an error on the current page, and then unblock it.However, it only execute the first $.blockUI(); and the second $.blockUI({ message: 'OK' }); or $.unblockUI(); when the ajax call is complete.It's not what I want, and I can't figure this out.
12594686	Set the Block UI in the beforeSend function and the unBlockUI in the complete function so that you get the behavior you are expecting.This will make sure your Ui will block as soon as the request is sent and unblock as soon as its completed..

Simple, powerful, free, decent documentation. Looks a bit clunky.

This sounds reasonable to me.The ICollection&lt;T&gt; abstraction can be viewed as an extension of the IReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt; abstraction. Note that List&lt;T&gt;, for example, implements both ICollection&lt;T&gt; and IReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt;.However it has not been designed that way. What am I missing here? Why would the current implementation have been chosen instead?UPDATEI'm looking for an answer that uses Object Oriented design reasoning to explain why:A concrete class such as List&lt;T&gt; implementing both IReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt; and ICollection&lt;T&gt;is a better design than:ICollection&lt;T&gt; implementing IReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt; directlyAlso please note that this is essentially the same question as:Why doesn't IList&lt;T&gt; implement IReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt;?Why doesn't IDictionary&lt;T&gt; implement IReadOnlyDictionary&lt;T&gt;?
12622784	There are probably several reasons. Here are two off the top:Huge backwards compatibility problemsHow would you write the definition of ICollection&lt;T&gt;? This looks natural:But it has a problem, because IReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt; also declares a Count property (the compiler will issue a warning here). Apart from the warning, leaving it as-is (which is equivalent to writing new int Count) allows implementors to have different implementations for the two Count properties by implementing at least one explicitly. This might be "amusing" if the two implementations decided to return different values. Allowing people to shoot themselves in the foot is rather not C#'s style.OK, so what about:Well, this breaks all existing code that decided to implement Count explicitly:Therefore it seems to me that there's no good solution to this problem: either you break existing code, or you force an error-prone implementation on everyone. So the only winning move is not to play.Semantic runtime type checksIt would be meaningless to write code like(or the equivalent with reflection) unless IReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt; is "opt-in": if ICollection&lt;T&gt; were a superset of IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Foo&gt; then pretty much every collection class under the sun would pass this test, making it not useful in practice.
12623150	This interface is more a description interface then really functional thing. In suggested approach every collection must be understood as something that you can onlly read ad is always the same. So you could not add or remove a thing after creation. We could ask our self why the interface is called IReadOnlyCollection, not 'IReadOnlyEnumerable' as it use IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, IEnumerable. The answer is easy this type of interface would not have any senece, because Enumerable is already 'read only'.So lets look in doc IReadOnlyCollection(T)The first (and last) senetece in description says:  Represents a strongly-typed, read-only collection of elements.And I think that this explain everything if you know what strong-typing is for.
12624412	But in my local repository, those branches are still showing up (even though they show up as having no changes).Branches will show up in your local repo unless you delete them. They don't disappear when you push them.The answers above tell you how to delete a branch. However, I would add that using the -D option is a bit more powerful. This option deletes the branch regardless of its (un)merged status:It's the atomic bomb of branch deletion. Use with care.
12632608	I would like to take one table that is heavy with flags and fields, and break it into smaller tables. The parent table to be revised/broken down already contains live data that must be handled with care.Here is my plan of attack, that I'm hoping to execute this weekend while no one is using the systsem.Create the new tables that we will needRename the existing parent table, ParentTable, to ParentTableOLDCreate a new table called ParentTable with the unneeded fields gone, and new fields addedRun a procedure to copy the entries in ParentTableOLD to the new tables, mapping old data to new tables/fields where applicableDelete the ParentTableOLD tableThe above seems pretty reasonable and simple to me, I'm fairly certain it will work. I'm interested in other techniques to achieve this (the above is the only thing I can think of), as well as any kind of tools to help stay organized. Right now I'm running on pen and paper.Reason I ask is that several times now, I've been re-inventing the wheel just because I didn't know any better, and someone more experienced came along and saw what I was doing and said, "oh there's a built-in way to help do this," or, "there's a simpler way to do this." I did coding for months and months with Visual Studio before someone stopped by and said "you know about breakpoints to step through the code, yeah?" --- life changing, hah.I have SQL Server 2008 R2 with SSMS.
12632677	Make a backup of database (for reference : ) and then you can do the required steps. If everything goes fine, then go ahead else restore the old database ( for reference : )You can even automate this process of making a backup for say, every week.
12632969	A good trick to assist you in creating your '_old' tables is:SELECT INTO will copy all of the data and create your table for you in one step.This said - I would actually retain the current table names and instead copy everything into another schema. This will make adapting queries and reports to run over the old schema (where needed) a lot easier then having to add '_old' to all the names (since instead you can just find/replace the schema names).
12633894	I would like to implement the delete functionality in listview. I want it to act it like most common android apps (like the email client..etc). What I mean, is that when you click on delete button then the list will have check boxes in which you can check and then proceed with the delete.I have my list view, but I am not sure about how the check box will appear (and will respond to clicks as opposed to the whole item responding to click), Any pointers on that? I thoght I would ask you first before I go on reinventing the wheel or bang my head against the wall.Thank you so much
12633903	When using tasks for large/long running workloads that I need to be able to cancel I often use a template similar to this for the action the task executes:The OperationCanceledException should not be logged as an error but must not be swallowed if the task is to transition into the cancelled state. Any other exceptions do not need to be dealt with beyond the scope of this method.This always felt a bit clunky, and visual studio by default will break on the throw for OperationCanceledException (Though I have 'break on User-unhandled' turned off now for OperationCanceledException because of my use of this pattern).Ideally I think I'd like to be able to do something like this:i.e. have some sort of exclusion list applied to the catch but without language support that is not currently possible (@eric-lippert: c# vNext feature :)).Another way would be through a continuation:but I don't really like that as the exception technically could have more than a single inner exception and you don't have as much context while logging the exception as you would in the first example (if I was doing more than just logging it).I understand this is a bit of a question of style, but wondering if anyone has any better suggestions?Do I just have to stick with example 1?Eamon
12633949	You can include checkbox in the listview row.xml and make its Visibility as GONE, then when you click on a Button that enables all the CheckBoxes just set a boolean true and referesh the ListView. On the basis of the boolean write the logic in getView() asAnd further for deleting you having to get the checked items and perform deletion of Data from the ListView and refresh the ListView again.UpdateFurther you can have a look at my blog about the ListView with CheckBox.
12633954	With you listView you can set following...See the working example at Here
12634183	I am not entirely sure of what you are trying to achieve here but I think the following pattern might helpYou might have observed that I have removed the throw statement from here. This will not throw the exception but will simply ignore it.Let me know if you intend to do something else.There is yet another way which is quite close to what you have exhibited in your code
12634185	So, what's the problem? Just throw away catch (OperationCanceledException) block, and set proper continuations:TPL distinguishes cancellation and fault. Hence, cancellation (i.e. throwing OperationCancelledException within task body) is not a fault. The main point: do not handle exceptions within task body without re-throwing them.
12642405	How can I force line height in CSS, in such way that no big letters will stretch the line height. Instead, they should clip under the above line, or even merge with the above line.CSS line-height seems to work like MS Word’s “at least” line height option by default. I want to make it work like MS Word’s “exactly” option.For example:There, the lines aren't the same height, because one line has some bigger letters in it. I want all lines to be the same height regardless.
12642529	No way. You can think about enlarge the line-height, for example 30px, and you will get the same height all the lines.
12643091	Glyphs (the visual representations of a character) are centered vertically within an inline box. If the line height is larger than the content height, half the difference is added as space at the top; the same amount is also added at the bottom.That's the case for the main, non bold, text in your example. When set on a non-replaced inline element, it specifies the height used to calculate the height of the surrounding line box.So in the bold text, you'll still have 8.5px above the font-size, which causes the issue.You can prevent it by setting a line-height smaller than the font-size ( check this demo ). As it's an inline element, and there's no overflow:hidden; it will still be enterely visible, but it won't add any pixel to the rest of the text's line height.As far as i know, it's not possible to "stretch" the letters, unless you use some CSS3 properties like transform:scale(value) etc.ReferenceCode:​CSS:
12643304	N00b here. Apologies in advance if this is a bad question.What's the difference, in effect, between these two jQuery declarations, if any?andOn a related note, why does this work ...... but this doesn't?
12643342	The .ready method ignores the passed in selector because the only valid object it can be called on is the document. It isn't recommended to use .on or .bind with the ready event. Also, you should never use 'document' because document is always available to you directly.
12643376	I've never seen it used asbefore and gathering from bjkeefe's comment and Kevin B's answer, it's not valid.Means once the page is fully loaded, execute the function. This is useful because then no jQuery will try to execute while the page is still loading and the particular element isn't loaded yet.The on function means that any events applied to a dynamically create element will still work as normal but I've never used on in this way before though so I can't guarantee that it would work in this scenario, I usually use on with something like click, hover etc. as what it does is make sure that any jQuery applied to dynamically created elements (elements created after the page has been loaded) will still work as without on, the jQuery would work on elements contained within the document normally but not on dynamically generated elements.

12651838	you should print into the char* instead.You could do something like
12651879	You can do a sprintf according to Anton, or to be more c++:(there's nothing wrong with sprintf, especially if you use snprintf instead).
12658190	In my computer science program we've been taught to work with child processes and forks and pipes and file descriptors etc etc in C, but we've never done comparable stuff in C++.Do you use the same libraries, or does C++ have some (hopefully simplified) systems libraries of its own?
12658198	The types of things you have described are actually system specific rather then C specific. If you look around you might be able to find some wrappers for them, but they are not part of the C++ standard (nor the C standard).As an example, there's no reason to use file descriptors in standard C. That's what the file struct, fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, etc are for. If you're using file descriptors it's because you're being taught about the operating system rather than about C.
12658489	There is nothing specific to C or C++ w.r.t processes, child processes, etc. What is available while you program in C should be available for C++. You can always use a wrapper class that can be designed for object oriented style and for the benefits of RAII.
12679777	I am new to C++ development and I was hoping someone could help me with something I have been trying to do.Say for example I want a function that will, given an integer input, return the number of distinct digits it contains.So for example, if I have three integers:If I pass 'a' into the function, I would expect the number 5 to be returned.If 'b' was passed into the function, I would expect '4' to be returned,If 'c' was passed into the function, then 1 would be returned, as they are the number of distinct numbers.Could someone please illustrate how I could achieve this?
12679839	if you mean to return a floating point to get a decimal just return it as a float and the compiler should to an implicit type conversion. this is not generally good code but it works. a better way might be to hand the value to a temporary float like
12679878	You mean you want to find the number of different decimal digit in the integer?(not compiled or tested but the basic idea should work)

12682081	I have strings that I read from the database, these strings are fed into String.Format method, if a string has '{' '}' braces but these braces are not escaped correctly for String.Format (i.e add another '{' to escape them) the String.Format will throw an exception.The string have any combination of these braces, so in essence the method needs to go through the string and figure out if '{' have a closing one and if together they form a valid place holder for String.Format (i.e. {5}), the ones that don't need to be escaped correctly.I can write a method to do that, but was wondering if there is anything built into .NET, or anything out there that already does this ?A string example is the following:Hello {0}, please refer to our user manual for more information {or contact us at: XXXX}"As you can tell feeding this into String.Format will throw an exception on the {or contact us at: XXXX}
12682197	I would suggest that perhaps the first step is training the user on proper English. In your example the {or contact us at: XXXX} part should have parenthesis instead of braces: such as (or contact us at: XXXX). There are certainly valid uses for { and } but those are not common and I can't think of a reason for them to appear in a resource string... This is the reason those particular characters where chosen to perform this function.Barring that: the answer is No. There is no built in way of doing this. It's also a very complicated problem that is better solved at the entry point by either warning the user or disallowing anything but the most basic usage like {1}
12682262	How about this:... assuming that the only strings that should not be escaped are of format {\d+}.There are two caveats here. First, we may encounter already-escaped curvy braces - {{. Fix for it is more-o-less easy: add more lookarounds...... in other words, when trying to replace a bracket, make sure it's a lonely one. )Second, formats themselves may not be so simple - and as the complexity of those that actually may be present in your strings grows, so does the regex's one. For example, this little beasty won't attempt to fix format string that start with numbers, then go all the way up to } symbol without any space in between:As a sidenote, even though I'm the one of those people that actually like to have two problems (well, sort of), I do shudder when I look at this.UPDATE: If, as you said, you need to escape each single occurrence of { and }, your task is actually a bit easier - but you will need two passes here, I suppose:
12689881	Consider a binary sequence:11000111I have to find sum of this series (actually in parallel)Sum =1+1+0+0+0+1+1+1= 5This is a waste of resource as why invest time in adding 0s?Is there any clever way to sum this sequence so I can avoid unnecessary additions?
12689948	Think of it as a string. You have to read each input symbol at least once, so you have a minimum of O(n) time. Adding is fast and only takes one cycle. Using some sort of conditional logic means unnecessary branching - but compilers these days will probably optimize it out anyways. If you want parallelism, then split the input string and process them concurrently. It's an embarrassingly parallel problem.
12690190	Operate at the byte level rather than the bit level. Use a small LUT to convert a byte to a population count. That way you're only doing one lookup and one add per 8 bits. Unless your data is likely to be very sparse this should be quite efficient.

12708449	I got it! I had the same problem too and in your code it looks like that a button is pressed, which causes the crash!Here is my suggestion:Two things to solve a SIGABRT:1) SIGABRT happens due to a runtime exception that isn't caught. When this happens there is some info written to the debugger console or the device console that explains the exact reason for the exception. You haven't shown us this text. It starts "Terminating application due to ..."Show us that text.2) If you run your app in the debugger and set a breakpoint on the exception throw function the app will stop when the exception is thrown and this will usually be enough to figure it out. Go to the debugger breakpoint pane and at the bottom left is a control that when clicked allows you to set an exception breakpoint.

12729458	I have an MPMoviePlayerController instance. I wish to check its playbackState property for one of a number of values. As such I do something like this:This works as expected but causes a compiler warning:  Use of logical '||' with constant operand.The compiler's fix is to use the bitwise | operator instead. Searching on Stack Overflow you will find a couple of answers suggesting the same thing. BUT using the bitwise OR really isn't what I need here.MPMoviePlaybackState is declared in MPMoviePlayerController.h:This isn't a bitmask (and nor would it make much sense for it to be so — the enumerated values are mutually exclusive modes, not flags to be combined). I really do want to use the logical ||.(In my particular case, with the underlying values being 0,1,2 the bitwise example might work but that's just a coincidence.)How should I rephrase to avoid the warning or what #pragma clang diagnostic ignored ... can I use to silence the warning? (Bonus points for pointing to a list of all such diagnostics — I cannot seem to locate one in the manual.)Thanks in advance!
12729459	I have a script where I use the rand function in PHP. Now I read some ghost stories that its real easy to predict those outcomes. Is this possible from the client-side?For example, let say we have a rand(0,10). Is it possible to predict the next number?
12729569	Obviously, the (enumval1 || enumval2 || ..) is wrong. You can't use the || operator like this, but only with logical expressions.The | operator works, because it's a simple bitwise OR, which will do job for you only and only if your enum members are different powers of 2 (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, ...). It's connected with bitwise representation of numbers in binary, which , if the number if the power of 2, is like this: 2->10, 4->100, 8->1000 etc. So, for 2 | 8 it will be like 0010 | 1000 = 1010, which isn't zero, and if statement will proceed.The compiler warnings are fully right and helping at this point. Use the switch(..) or if(..) else if(..) statements, or make your enum like this:
12729570	I suggest using a switch/case block with fall trough logic like that:This will result in the intended behaviour with as less code as possible. Enums are made for exact the switch case kind of business. And they are performance optimized more than "if" statements, becuase the CPU does not even have to test the values when reaching the code. The compiler calculates the correct ASM jump offset at that location. So its as fast as lighning :)
12729689	rand() function returns a pseudorandom number .This does NOT mean that the next number can be predicted.However this image can explain the concept of word pseudorandomYou can read this articlethe image is generated from a simple loop with rand function on windows system.It's not so random, really? But now that you know it... you can predict the next number? The difference between true random number generators (TRNGs) and pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) is that TRNGs use an unpredictable physical means to generate numbers (like atmospheric noise), and PRNGs use mathematical algorithms (completely computer-generated)  [...]  Not many PRNGs will produce an obvious visual pattern like this, it just so happens to be a really bad combination of language (PHP), operating system (Windows), and function (rand()).
12729690	Do not trust these ghost stories. For webapps, prediction is impossible and next number cannot be determined from the client side.Why?Because random number generator is seeded before every request and client cannot see the seed value! Prediction works only if all numbers were generated in the same request.row of many numbers will not be really randomnext number (in the following http request) cannot be determined from the client side

12730203	I have an object model like: My question is, if I do something like:Is there a clean way for the parent to be aware of the new child object so I can do something (like have the parent send out a birth announcement)? I'd rather not have the child do it (they can't even spell, let alone afford stamps). :)I can imagine using an observer, or an after_create in the child to call a public method on the parent (calling parent.look_at_me). Ideally I'd like something that I define in the parent. Any other ideas?
12730387	You need to make sure you do the appropriate migration. See here. Given you've done that, the code above will automatically associate a_parent to its child.
12731685	You can use Association callbacksThis would work in cases like this:However, ORM is leaky abstraction, so it won't be hard to miss such callback. It's always possible to create a child without instantiating parent, so perhaps after_create in child isn't that bad of an idea.

12740268	i have a lot of if statements in while loop, program has to print error messages according to conditions, but if there are more than one error it has to be only one of them.
12740339	If you want to break after any error that is encountered, use breakIf you want to ignore the current iteration after any error is encountered , use continueIf you want to terminate the execution after any error is encountered, use exit
12740355	Your question isn't very detailed so it's a little hard to tell what exactly do you want. If you want the while loop to go to the next iteration after any error has fired, you should use the continue statement:If nothing else than these ifs is inside the loop, and the conditions are integer values, you should consider using switch instead:If you want to completely restart the cycle... well this is a little harder. Since you have a while loop, you can just set the condition to it's starting value. For example, if you have a loop like this:then you can "reset" it like this:However, you should be really careful with this, it's easy to get an infinite loop accidentally.

12746927	I have a table that stores a person's information with close to 10 million rows. Currently State is a char(2) field on the person table. This leads to tons of duplication of data as you would expect. If I normalize State data into it's own table and create an FK to it in the person table would this result in faster query times?Before:After:It seems to me that this would accomplish an increase in performance but I am far from an expert when it comes to optimizing queries.
12746984	Normalization can result in decreased performance, but rarely if ever will it increase your performance in a case like this, because now the server has to look at two places on disk instead of just one.Normalization has two purposes:Reduce the amount of data stored on the diskAllow data to be updated in a single placeYour query will not benefit from either of these advantages as there is not much of a difference between a char(2) and an int (the foreign key)the two digit code for a state will never change, so you will never need to update it
12747096	Searching on string indexes is (in theory) much slower than searching on int indexes. Which means yes; normalizing your data would make it faster. In practice, I've often seen the difference to be minimal; YMMV. You may have to pre-cache or separately select the state ids:As always with queries, it is best to test and optimize.

12788590	Try this:There is a big error in your code: The line declaring myDer01 actually declares a function and not a a variable. But even if you had written (Derived()) instead of Derived it would have been wrong, since you cannot construct a shared pointer from an object &mdash; only from a pointer! So you really want to say new Derived.
12788609	shared_ptr is a class template and each invocation of that template with different parameters will result in a separate class. The solution is to create only shared pointers to the base class.
12788771	Apple (and Google) does give the option to 'save' the purchase history for you so a user can restore it if he deleted his app or switched to a new device. The functionality given by Google and Apple is very limited, however and you can easily implement a better functionality on your own.

12794307	You have to understand that client-server communication is a bit unidirectional. From iPhone to server you can easily send messages (and get responses), but to send a message from server to iPhone you have to implement socket connection between them, so the iPhone will always "listen" to what the server is "saying". Also, push notifications are a way to send messages from server to device, but it's not your case, I guess.

12803346	I'm trying to get the hang of inheritance in Java and have learnt that when overriding methods (and hiding fields) in sub classes, they can still be accessed from the super class by using the 'super' keyword.What I want to know is, should the 'super' keyword be used for non-overridden methods?Is there any difference (for non-overridden methods / non-hidden fields)?I've put together an example below. and Specifically, given that getTyreCost() hasn't been overridden, should getTotalTyreReplacementCost() use getTyreCost(), or super.getTyreCost() ?I'm wondering whether super should be used in all instances where fields or methods of the superclass are accessed (to show in the code that you are accessing the superclass), or only in the overridden/hidden ones (so they stand out).
12803396	It is advised that further changes to the inherited class will not necessitate addition of the super qualifier and also prevent errors if missed.
12804125	Don't use the super keyword to refer to other methods which aren't overrided. It makes it confusing for other developers trying to extend your classes.Let's look at some code which does use the super keyword in this way. Here we have 2 classes: Dog and CleverDog:Now, imagine you are a new developer on the project, and you need some specific behavior for a clever dog who is on TV: that dog has to do all its tricks, but should go by its fictitious TV name. To accomplish this, you override the getName(...) method...... and fall into a trap set by the original dev and their unusual use of the super keyword!The code above isn't going to work - because in the original CleverDog implementation, getName() is invoked using the super keyword. That means it always invokes Dog.getName() - irrelevant of any overriding. Consequently, when you use your new DogOnTv type...... you get the wrong output:This is not the usual expected behavior when you override a method, so you should avoid creating this kind of confusion using the super keyword where it doesn't belong.If, however, this is actually the behavior you want, use the final keyword instead - to clearly indicate that the method can't be overrided:

There were so many structures defined asbut there were still some other structures defined asThen, in some other header file, such as ngx_core.h, do some typedef:My question is (maybe duplicated...): Why do authors not use the same form to define all structures?In which case(s) should we use typedef on a struct definition? Is there any OO or design pattern considerations?
12812262	You use typedef on a structure mainly as a matter of convenience. For example:This allows you to define variables of type List simply as:instead of:All those extra struct statements clutter up your code. The other use of typedef as you show it, is to implement one type as another. For example:This defines a new type Queue to be a previously defined type List. This then allows you to use Queue as you would use List.

I assume myself as a vim beginner. It's quite difficult for me to change my editor at one moment. I think than vim plugin for my current editor can give me easy way to feel more comfort in new environment.
12817124	i guess there are none but you can make it look like vim using the style configuration in notepad++settings -> Style Configuration -> Theme -> vim Dark Blue
12818855	Most of what makes Vim what it is derives from the fact that it's a modal editor. If there's no way to turn NP++ into a modal editor you won't get far. A quick look at NP++ plugins page shows no Vi[m] plugin so I'd answer "no".Whatever, the best way to learn Vim is to use it. I'd suggest you keep using NP++ for serious work and force yourself to use Vim for everything else. Once, if ever, you'll be ready, drop NP++ and use Vim full time.

12819676	I'm trying to understand the concept of multithread programming. I know the concept of deadlock and mutexes but i cannot find an answer to the following question. How the problem of deadlock can arise when mutexes are used?
12819885	Here is a concrete example of how to provoke deadlock in Java. We spawn two threads. The first one acquires a mutex lock on a, then waits a second, then tries to acquire a lock on b. The second acquires a lock on b, then waits, then tries to acquire a. The result is that the program enters deadlock and runs forever. Note that this code is not guaranteed to enter deadlock. The thread scheduler is perfectly within its rights to run the first thread to completion before starting on the second thread, or vice versa. Due to the massive waiting time in this example, it's pretty much certain the system will enter deadlock, but if instead of sleeping for one second, both threads were doing some computation of a variable time length before each lock acquisition, any of the following things could happen at random:deadlock"Acquired a, then b.", followed by "Acquired b, then a.""Acquired b, then a.", followed by "Acquired a, then b."How do you prevent this from happening?Avoid using threads altogether whenever you can get away with it.Instead of having shared resources between threads, have each thread operate on its own data, and send each other immutable messages.If you absolutely must use shared resources, minimize the number of mutex locks used. If everything synchronizes on the same object, there is only one mutex lock, and deadlock can't happen.If you absolutely must have lots of mutex locks, with threads acquiring combinations of them, do the following: write a function that defines a total ordering of the locks. Then, whenever you need to do an operation involving multiple mutexes, create the list of mutexes involved, sort them, then enter them in the sorted order right at the start of the operation.Have a look at the java.util.concurrent package. It contains lots of goodies that take care of many of the truly hairy bits.Also, I cannot overstate the degree to which the threads may switch in unexpected places. A common mistake is to look at each thread line-by-line and imagine different ways in which the lines could interleave. But that's not enough: a thread might be switched out in the middle of some nested function call deep within some library.

This is assuming they are both devices with USB OTG and have kernels that support it.I've tried searching for this but cannot find a good starting point.

12842684	Is there ability to get in some way Balance on CreditCard ? No.   API of Authorize.net or Paypal were examined on this subject and no results.  That's because you can't get someone else's balance. It's private information.  In real life any cash terminal can show to you balance on your credit card. That is why I assume there is some way to get this balance in web through some payment gateway. Emphasis on the 'show to you' part because you own the card. And the only allowed parties involved is the cardholder (with card in hand and pin) and the issuing bank and/or card company. Even over the phone there are security checks (Date of birth, zip/postal code, etc)You will (should) never be able to get, through an API, gateway solution, or otherwise, the card holders balance unless you are affiliated with the issuing credit card and have been requested by the card holder after security checks. This would be a gaping security and privacy hole. Think of all the professional credit card theifs being able to pull the balance amounts on thousands of credit cards in order to help know which cards and how much of an amount to charge, transfer and extort.

12861615	One of my app is to upload video to facebook account.I checked on web, but found that most of solution are old or removed. Is there any updated solution?Welcome any comment
12864937	This website has a lot of great API references and specific one just for Facebook check it out and also check your grammar.
12869455	ContextBefore you can publish onto Facebook, you must get publish (write) permissions, using either native integration or the Facebook SDK, the rule is you must first acquire read permissions before write permissions.Thus, make sure that before you attempt to upload a video, you should have requested basic info (email for example), then, once you have this, you can request write permissions. The permission necessary for uploading videos is publish_stream.Using iOS 6 native Facebook integrationUsing the native iOS 6 Facebook integration, you should use the requestForServiceType:requestMethod:URL:parameters: method of SLRequest, as follows:Here it's important to note that the video data does not go into the parameters dictionary, it must be added to the SLRequest object using the addMultipartData:withName:type:filename: method.Also note that the filename is very important when adding the videos data. Here I am just using the full path of the file.Using Facebook SDK 3.1 libraryIf you must support iOS versions earlier then iOS 6 or you wish to use the Facebook SDK 3.1 for any other reason, uploading a video is a little different.You must use a FBRequest object and a NSDictionary that contains the videos details. The method I recommend using is requestWithGraphPath:parameters:HTTPMethod:, I've used this method out of preference although you should be able to use some of the other methods to create your request object.The following code works with Facebook SDK 3.1 to upload a video:Here as you can see, we add the videos data into the parameters dictionary unlike the previous solution, it's there along with title and description (which are 2 optional parameters). Also note that here there is no key source, as specified by the Facebook documentation. The key's name is the filename of the video. I don't know why this shouldn't be source, but using source results in a com.facebook.sdk error 5.The bug I mentioned I filed with Facebook, you can see this report on this link - unless I'm mistaken in my interpretation of the documentation. Please try out that bug and report if you can reproduce it. Thanks !

This inherited environment copy is local to the child process. Any changes to this local environment are discarded once this child process exists.

12882385	Your loop is probably an infinite loop. Your condition from1&lt;=upto1 never changes.
12882432	Probably rsum.setText(summ); is the culprit. setText(int) expects a resource id, not an arbitrary integer. If you want to show the sum, you must convert it to a CharSequence first and set this.You can also rewrite your for loop to summ = from1 * (upto1 - from1 + 1);, which should be a lot cheaper and set the EditText afterwards.

12888572	I'm using codeigniter with jquery and it would be nice if you explain me how to protect the controller from direct access.For example,I have view with that standard jquery line: Tools it is my controller with function for loading statistics. If I write direct in browser full address of script , browser open, of course, that data.How to protect direct controller access from browser ? I want my data were loaded only in view, not on controller direct access.
12888677	Make this as the first line in your controller_name.php file
12888695	In general you can't do it in a meaningful way due to the need to provide access and the simplicity of HTTP. Or more basically, you can't deny access to information you need to provide (in this case stateless connection info). The best initial steps are to make sure that the controller only allows access to data that the user should have access to (regardless of how they connect), rather than trying to restrict based on the easily tampered with request information.That being said, if you have some odd reason to really chase after this, you could use some form of single use token passed with the AJAX request. You could, for instance, generate a random key, persist it somewhere (ideally just in memory in something like a hash table since there should never be a long enough delay to warrant otherwise) and pass it out with the page that will issue the ajax request. The token is passed back with the request and removed, and then that token will no longer be valid. The controller would not be able to be accessed directly since it would need a token.This would still be able to be worked around since the process could be halted and an issued token used, but it would deter anyone just playing around with curl (so really its not worth the effort).Long story short, you can't do this in any way that anyone couldn't work around within 10 minutes. Focus on making sure you only expose the data you want no matter how its retrieved.
12897013	I'm designing a library application for my school. We have a 2-3 main libraries and some departments have their own libraries. I wanted to know whether these queries seem correct ?The two questions I want to solve are:Find how many copies of a particular book existFind out which libraries have a particular book Here's what I have:My questions regarding these queries:Does it seem unnecessary to have a separate lookup table and merge the libId into Books table and have it as a foreign key on the book table ? Do the queries seem correct ?
12897126	Your first query is missing a FROM clause. You could also do COUNT(*), but it doesn't particularly matter in this case:To find out which libraries have a particular book, you don't need a COUNT() aggregate. Instead you need a WHERE clause with your join. The COUNT() would tell you how many libraries have a book, but not which libraries. For that you want a query which returns Libraries.Name.The lookup table is appropriate because it allows you to normalize books down to a single record in the Books table if it exists in multiple libraries. As you have it, there is no real reason to have multiple copies in the Books table, and no reason for the Book ID column. In fact, the Book ID column as it is is quite misleading. There are books with two different titles having the same id 1. The Books table really ought to look like the following, with one record per book title (assuming title as the authority, forgetting about real authoritative things like ISBN)If you have multiple copies of each book possible at each library, you may consider normalizing the books per copy into a table that identifies them by library barcode. You would then match those ids to libraries as holdings:To query, for example, the number of copies per book per library, you would use:
12897165	Your books table looks more like an "Instances of a book" table. As such, it shouldn't have the bookname. Either that, or the BookID column is superfluous.Your second query is correct, if you are writing SQL from 1988. If not, you should use the join syntax.
12907038	headjs does some very crazy JavaScript type things to its API. For instance it takes an arbitrary number of strings (not a string array) for a function. Sometimes it ends that same function call, you can optionally end it with a function, for example.You can also (just as easily) do the followingMy question is how the HECK do we describe that in a declaration file? I am all ears here as my current pass seems completely wrong.
12907137	The declaration is simply:The function arguments part of a function declaration in Javascript is just advisory. When calling a function Javascript allows you to call with less than the declared number of arguments (arguments not passed in defaults to undefined) or with more than the declared number of arguments.When a function is called, an arguments object is created. The arguments object is a bit like an array (though it is not a proper Array object) that holds each passed in argument.So, for example, to handle infinite arguments you can simply do:So now you can call foo like:Beyond that, it is simply a matter of using typeof, itstanceof etc. to detect what type of argument is passed in and process them accordingly.
12907426	The TS language spec refers to variable number/spread parameters as "Rest Parameters". An example interface with a function signature that accepts rest params:Unfortunately, there are some limitations. The "Rest Parameter" has to be the last one in a function's signature -- so you won't be able to capture the type of the callback parameter since it is after the repeating parameter.If it wasn't, you would have been able to do something like this:

12910542	We are currently reviewing how to isolate our core business components (in the code) from the front end development. We already have multi-tier architecture but they are referenced using dll (or webservices in some places).What we would like to do is to outsource some part of UI to external developers. The problem is that we have to provide the dll which can be reverse engineered and the core business logic code then can be "obtained". One way to tackle this instead of exposing BO using dll, use Webservices to expose BO. However there are few problems. for e.g. Security, Debugging, exception handling, hosting etc. To me this does not sound right for the issues mentioned above but also web services are not meant for such problems. I am wondering does anyone has come across similar scenario? or If someone has done this? if so how?Thanks,

In case the approach is applicable it will have a profound effect on efficiency.In stead of having to do the mapping of business issues to technical issues over and over againthe process can be made repeatable and eventually automated.

12918379	The concept of interface contract seems spot-on here.If the contracts of your interfaces are well defined (let them be DLL entry points, WSDLs, whatever), it should not be very difficult to create a mock implementation that allows the UI developers to test the behaviour. The only precaution we took is to ask UI contractors to commit code into our SVN repository (no, no Git here :)) so that our build machine could run integration tests continuously and we could assess progresses and issues on a daily basis.

12937097	I have createa an app that is based on "Single View Application" Xcode template. It has a navigation controller and a rootViewController.When I am on the rootViewController and I dothe new view controller is animated in.My problem is this. I have presented a lot of viewControllers in sequence, that isor in other words, I have presented B from A using presentModalViewController, C from B and so one. Yes, I have to use presentModalViewController because I have a special animation going on to transition between viewControllers and I cannot use [self.navigationController push...My question is: what happens when I use presentModalViewController regarding to the navigation stack? Is the controller being presented pushed to some stack? is there a way to obtain references to all navigationControllers that were presented at a given time? something like that navigation stack? I mean, suppose I am on D and I want to get a list of all controllers presented before D.I know I can create properties and pass that along. I am just wondering if theres something already built on iOS that does that.thanks.
12937285	In iOS 5 and later, UIViewController has a presentingViewController property that returns the view controller that presents the receiver. In iOS 4 and earlier, use the parentViewController property of the presented view controller to access its presenting view controller. So you can access, for example, the C view controller from D by accessing these properties appropriately. See the docs for further information.If you want to access all the view controllers as in a chain, you can do this:
12937293	I'd subsequently check the size of the viewControllers property from your UINavigationController after every modal presentation, and check if it grows or not.

12993920	Regexp#match(str, index) gives me the first match after index in string which is great for iterating through each match in from left to right. But how can I find the last match before a given index? String#rindex gives the index of the last match but what if I want the full match data?Example:...should yield...
12994136	You could limit how far into the string the regexp may match by sub-stringing the string.String#scan will repeatedly apply a regexp returning an Array of all matches, from which you just select the last one.
12994149	You could reverse the string, reverse the regex, and use length(str) - index for the start point. Reversing a regex is simple if the language it represents is really regular. Greediness or lack thereof can lead to edge cases you'd have to think through.If the regex has a Kleene star, I believe this is the only way to get the job done unless you build your own reverse regex matcher, which is a big project.

That's not the point of the question, just wondering if I'm the only one aware of this.What I'd like to know is if there was any usecase to create mutable enums?And I'd also like to know the limits of what we can do with enums (good practice or not).I've not tested it, but maybe an enum can be injected with Spring beans?At least it seems we can annotate each instance (@Deprecated works fine for exemple), and also the methods.

13019557	You can just use an equality comparator in the query, to directly search the value you're looking for.Why would you want to loop through your database until you found it when you can just specify what you're searching for ?You didn't give an example of what value it is you're searching for, so if it is a stringHowever, if you do want to put some extra load on your database (which it is in this undefined case), you'd have a stored procedure, looping through ID's stored in the database.For that, take a look at the following post, which might give you some inspiration : SQL LOOP INSERT Based on List of ID&#39;s
13019955	Having cleared the problem of "not there being an order", that is, you will have to choose some kind of ordering (for example the order of primary key, or the order in which the records were assigned OIDs), your question becomes:So you select the minimum row for which the value is 543or maybe, for other purposes, something likeand then select all records before that one:So your table could be:and you would get:You don't see the order, but there must be one. Here it is the order on id.As you requested, value can be whatever - a text, or even an image BLOB - and the "ordering" stays hidden.In some other language you would do something like:but then either the SELECT's order would not be specified, and you might get every time a different result, or it would be the order of tuple insertion in the table. Which is the same as using id explicitly.

13039046	To get the max value you should declare an instance variable and use it to hold the largest value the mapper() method has seen so far. You may need some way to indicate that no value has been seen, yet. When the cleanup() method is finally called the variable holds the value you want.Returning this value is a bit more difficult. Hadoop workflow engines all use variant of the following approach to passing data between hadoop jobs. You can use this approach to pass the max value to whoever needs it when the job is done. The hack/kludge involves using a well-known hdfs directory (could be passed in) and the taskid to build a unique, discoverable filename to hold the value. Use HDFS file io API's to write the value out.

Note that this doesn't validate the year itself as basically any number of years is valid. Depending on the concrete functional requirement, you might want to do an additional check on the year, e.g. split string on / and then check if the length of the 1st part is 4.

If you return a different status, jQuery will not try to read the response. It will instead look for status code handlers set in the statusCode option that is passed to Example
13076772	I was facing this problem earlier today, and since I could not find a satisfactory solution, I decided to change my class design, and have seperate properties such as Tag 1, Tag 2, Tag 3 etc.My main problem is the fact that I need to bind a grid to an object that contains a list among other properties and I need to show each item in the list as a separate column which I am unable to do. Hence I am resorting to declaring variables separately. Original question is here...Now, I'm facing one of the most common design problem that probably every programmer has at some point of time. Here is the code to demonstrate it,Here tags is a string array.I was wondering if there is a more elegant way to do this. Another thing to note is that the efficiency of this loop decreases as it progresses, since with more iterations it has to check more conditions. If we could remove a condition after it had become true once it would speed up each iteration since we know that each condition will become true only once in all the iterations

13079187	I made a lazy-load on tableview using the CellFactory class... I´ll try to explain, anyone with better english than mine fell free to edit and make it more understandable!First I use a mandatory property in a Bean to check if that bean has already been loaded or not. This way I don't need to create an attribute specifically for that.Second, I loaded into TableView my Bean collection just with the 'id' property loaded, what makes my table display all in blank.At last, I create a CellFactory, like this one below, to check if object has loaded or not, and if not do it now.In the method loadPersonBean I pass the object contained in TableView Collection and load it from DataBase. Than I COPY all the needed data to the bean received from the table. I didn't try to swap the object in TableView, but I believe it may result a Concurrent Exception.Other observation: In all my tests TableView always respects the column order to call my CellFactory, but I did not test if it still respects the order if user swap the column order. So I prefer to add a CellFactory with the "LazyLoadCheck" part of code to all columns.Hope I made my self clear enough to help! If any questions remains, comment and I'll try to do a better explanation.
13099406	A bit of a philosophical question, I suppose. Hope it belongs here.C language has the standard set of bit-wise operations, including OR, AND, XOR, SHIFT LEFT/RIGHT, NOT. Anyone has an idea why rotate left/rotate right isn't included in the language? These operators are of the same complexity as other bit-wise operators and normally require a single assembly instruction, like the others. Besides, I can think of a lot of uses for rotate operator, probably not less than, say, xor operator - so it sounds a bit strange to me that they aren't included in C along with the rest.Edit:Please stop suggesting implementations of rotation operators. I know how to do that and it's not what the question about.
13099459	C doesn't have rotate-left and rotate-right for binary. You can code rotate left and rotate-right functions yourself. But as per standards: nope. Simple rotate-left :The above functions will work with 32 bit integers only :)Now for the philosophy: C was meant to be portable as much as possible. That's what the standards team want it to be "a portable assembler". There is no guarantee that rol and ror is present on architectures of the future. Or might behave differently. Hence it was kept away from standards.
13099518	I think it's because there are two types of rotations: with and without carry, which makes the rotation to be done differently, according to the resulting machine's CARRY flag (1 or 0). That would imply implementing a total of 4 operators, thus making the language unnecessarily complex, provided that rotation can be simply implemented as @Aniket has shown.EDIT:Nevertheless, shifting may also be done signed and unsigned. Actually Javascript has both operators, AFAIK. However, since C supports signed and unsigned variables, I think it has no sense to perform signed shifts, because the compiler should know whether we are shifting a signed or unsigned variable. Signed/unsigned shifts are useful for arithmetical computations, and a C compiler may use them to generate the assembly code. For instance, many arithmetical operations such as multiplying or dividing by a power of 2 are translated by the compiler into shift operations. The only reason we have shift operators in C is for working with bitmasks.

13106331	You may want to set up some sort of caché. I'd use a redis machine for that. That way you could avoid to go to MongoDB so often.
13107635	You don't need to:Change the way you queryChange your schemaMongoDB, and pretty much any other database, has something called indexes. These allow for O(log n) operations on data values which result in much faster queries, not only that but they are designed to be a sort of cache to your data and can reside in memory.You can simply imply an index on name by:db.uses.ensureIndex({name:1})I would recommend you look into this side of databases more:How does database indexing work?Those links should get you started. The theory and implementation of indexes is mostly the same across all databases. MongoDB does do some fun stuff with memory but apart from that it is the same.EditI realised I read the question a little wrong. You want to store a list of ALL users names since you need them all at once.For a large user base I don't think Redis could do this adequately (actually I am 90% sure it can't) and nor could any aggregated document structure in MongoDB and housing that for a large user based in memory would be troublesome to say the least, one for memory requirements of housing the structure.I recommend you really think of why you need that. You should really plan out your query scenario and think of the requirements, you are going down an odd path here.
13110264	Possible Duplicate: Should global css styles be set on the html element or the body element? There's some really interesting discussion about applying CSS to &lt;html&gt; and &lt;body&gt; in order to get some cool effects — like two background images, one transparent (but CSS3 may render that useless).However, for the standard cases, which element is most appropriate to use for appling page-wide CSS to?Perhaps there's even some CSS properties that are better suited to one selector over the other? Thus, split among the two?(This concerns things like cross-browser compatibility, as well as proper semantics according to spec.)And we can also bring the wildcard * { } selector into this discussion.
13110310	For creating a site with several pages it is best to use the CSS as an external linked page. That way each page can have access to it. But for a single page to page, it would be a "cool effect" on some browsers. But in the same effect other computers might see those effects in a different and less rendered method. Stick with uses the CSS mostly as an external link, and use style tags only as needed, or leave a note on the page of how and what browser they are supposed to view it on.

13114043	Let's say you have a class and you create a HashSet which can store this instances of this class. If you try to add instances which are equal, only one instance is kept in the collection, and that is fine. However if you have two different instances in the HashSet, and you take one and make it an exact copy of the other (by copying the fields), the HashSet will then contain two duplicate instances. Here is the code which demonstrates this:The output from the above code:Is there a way to force the HashSet to validate its contents so that possible duplicate entries created as in the above scenario get removed? A possible solution could be to create a new HashSet and copy the contents from one hashset to another so that the new hashset won't contain duplicates however I don't like this solution.

13136349	Indeed, that isn't going to work - the compiler has no way of knowing the T from that. Remember that the T comes from the caller at compile-time, not from the result of the method at runtime. There are ways to switch between reflection/generics, but it is ugly and isn't going to help much here. I would just return object instead:and then let the caller handle the dynamic etc:Because of the dynamic above, the .status in the two Console.WriteLine will still work.

13139359	I've started with HTML and CSS a couple weeks ago and this happened several times, and I don't know why.Sometimes I apply a background to the parent element, include something on it, but the height of the parent stays 0 instead receiving height of the children. And sometimes it does (which I believe should be the correct behavior no?)My glossarySelector gets 0 height. Therefore my background color is not displayed.Why?You can see the full code here.
13139535	EDIT: This SO answer provides several ways of solving this issue, each with their advantages and disadvantages: An element is completely flat (0px height) when it has no children or if the children are removed from the page flow using position: absolute or floating. Since the list elements all have float: left there are no more elements inside glossarySelector to expand it's height.I see you've created a class called "clearFix". Just add a div with that class inside the glossarySelector div to fix the floating issue:Fiddle:
13139593	The default display mode of a div is "block", wich does not wrap around it's content in all cases. You should add display: inline-block;In your code, the list will still overlap on the right side, because of the left: 30px of the ul element, but if you replace it by margin-left:30px; or padding-left:30px; it will work fine ;)

13182294	You should use Callable which can return value rather than Runnable The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, in that both are designed for classes whose instances are potentially executed by another thread. A Runnable, however, does not return a result and cannot throw a checked exception. Then use it like belowThis is one shot schedule so it will execute only one time you will need to schedule it again once the get call is returned. However in your case it will be easy to use a simple AtomicInteger and call addAndGet compare the returned value once your condition arrive cancel the scheduling by calling cancel.
13182612	If you want to return the result from doMathForAMinute, then you need not ScheduledExecutorService at all. Just make a loop which runs calculation and then Thread.sleep(). The whole idea of using ScheduledExecutorService is to free the thread which starts the task from waiting the result, but here you are not going to free it. If, as I suspect, the thread which calls doMathForAMinute is the GUI thread, then it is totally wrong, as your gui would stuck and do not respond for a minute. Instead, doMathForAMinute should only start parallel calculations and the parallel task should itself update UI using runOnUiThread or some other way. See also:Android: runOnUiThread does not always choose the right thread?Where do I create and use ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor, TimerTask, or Handler?

13194627	You need to use session_start(); not start_session()Always ensure that you test your PHP scripts manually, not just pointing to the page with ajax. Go to it and make sure it works. :-)If you tested this (assuming error_reporting is on), you will have received an error stating that you are trying to call an undefined function.UPDATEIn addition to the session_start() issue, you have may other problems in your code.First step is to debug using either console.log('hello'); or alert('hello'). Bind these actions to the form submit event and this will tell you whether or not the submit function is being called.Once you have done this then you can continue to debug the rest :-)UPDATE 2From looking at your jQuery, it would appear that you are attaching the submit event to the wrong element in the DOM. You need to attach it to the form, not a div. Like so:andTIP: Use CSS to space elements, don't use br tags. Just my opinion :-)
13194699	If you don't want to submit the form:Change the type="submit" of the submit_btn into a type="button".Bind the the AJAX call of the session_update.php page to the submit_btn click event.

I've looked at this post , but I don't have the option to change this functionality, and the other solutions on don't work.Basically, I have a disabled login button if the fields are empty on load. But when a browser fills in the input, it doesn't enable the button. I'm trying to find how to see if it changes.I'm using jQuery and JS.I've tried .change, on .ready, on .load, and all. It seems to happen after the .load event.Does anyone know a solution to this? I would like to avoid using any sort of timeout.
13197652	I think there is no way to detect if the browser has some buil-in feature that pre-populates the fields.You could solve the problem with the a timer that enable the button, if something is there.Something like this:

13205499	You are not actually using global varaibles. My scopes the variables them local to the main routine, so when you call the subroutine, $file and @attributes are scoped to the subroutine, not to the main routine.Change my to our for $file and @attributes to make the variables global and available to the subroutine.You can check this for yourself by using the -d argument for perl to run it in the debugger and check the values of the items.

13206926	When my application starts, and it has just been upgraded, I am doing a local database update (sqlite). It is like that:The user starts my app, and then I start the upgrade process. During this upgrade process I am showing a form that has a continuous progressbar. This form closes when the upgrade process is done and the user can then start using my application.But the progressbar won't animate since the upgrade process is so intensive. In my old VB6 version I used an ActiveX-Exe that has 1 form and shows a progressbar. This was my "background worker".I am not sure if I can use the same approach in VB.NET.I have only seen examples that then do the work in the background worker, but I have not seen any examples where the progressbar itself was the background worker.The database upgrade needs to be blocking, the user may NOT use my application before the database upgrade was done. This means that only the progressbar should "out of process", but not the upgrading. Thank you very much!
13208260	You can raise an event in the background worker and then update the progress bar on the UI thread. You can raise events in your class and handle them in the form. When they are raised, you can call reportprogress() on the background worker.some more info:Performing long running UI changes without blocking the main thread
13208851	Using global variables is usually quite bad and points to a design error. In this case, the error seems to be that you don't know how to pass arguments to a sub.Here is the pattern in Perl:Subs are invoked like(Do not invoke them as &amp;nameOfTheSub, this makes use of very special behaviour you don't usually want.)This would printSubroutines can return values, either with the return statement or as the value of the last statement that is executed. These subs are equivalent:I would write your getfileattributes asWhat is happening here? I take an argument $name and then return a list of values. The return keyword could be omitted. The return takes a list of values and does not require parens, so I leave them out. The TEST ? TRUE-STATEMENT : FALSE-STATEMENT operator is known from other languages.Then, in your loop, the sub would be invoked likeorNotes:say is like print, but adds a newline at the end. To use it, you have to have a Perl > 5.10 and you should use 5.010 or whatever version or use feature qw(say).always use strict; use warnings; unless you know better for sure.Often, you can write programs without assigning to a variable twice (Single assignment form). This can make reasoning about control flow much easier. This is why global variables (but not global constants) are bad.

13235412	I have saved multidimensional arrays in Matlab before (e.g. an array A that has size 100x100x100) using a .mat file and that worked out very nicely.What is the best way to save such multidimensional arrays in C? The only way I can think of is to store it as a 2D array (e.g. convert a KxNxM array to a KNxM array) and be careful in remembering how it was saved. What is also desired is to save it in a way that can be opened later in Matlab for post-processing/plotting.
13235502	Triple pointer: This way the method to access at each value if quite intuitive: X[i][j][k].If instead you want, you can use an unique array: And you access to each element this way: If you use a triple pointer, don't forget to free the memory.
13236061	C does 3D arrays just fine:although for very large arrays such as in your example, you would want to allocate the arrays dynamically instead of declaring them as auto variables such as above, since the space for auto variables (usually the stack, but not always) may be very limited.Assuming all your dimensions are known at compile time, you could do something like:This will allocate a D0xD1xD2 array from the heap, and you can access it like any regular 3D array. If your dimensions are not known until run time, but you're working with a C99 compiler or a C2011 compiler that supports variable-length arrays, you can do something like this:If your dimensions are not known until runtime and you're working with a compiler that does not support variable-length arrays (C89 or earlier, or a C2011 compiler without VLA support), you'll need to take a different approach. If the memory needs to be allocated contiguously, then you'll need to do something like the following:Note that you have to map your i, j, and k indices to a single index value. If the memory doesn't need to be contiguous, you can do a piecemeal allocation like so:and deallocate it asThis is not recommended practice, btw; even though it allows you to index data as though it were a 3D array, the tradeoff is more complicated code, especially if malloc fails midway through the allocation loop (then you have to back out all the allocations you've made so far). It may also incur a performance penalty since the memory isn't guaranteed to be well-localized. EDITAs for saving this data in a file, it kind of depends on what you need to do.The most portable is to save the data as formatted text, such as:This writes the data out as a sequence of floating-point numbers, with a newline at the end of each row, and two newlines at the end of each "page". Reading the data back in is essentially the reverse:Note that both of these snippets assume that the array has a known, fixed size that does not change from run to run. If that is not the case, you will obviously have to store additional data in the file to determine how big the array needs to be. There's also nothing resembling error handling. I'm leaving a lot of stuff out, since I'm not sure what your goal is.

Same as BCount.If ACount value is -1 and the previous date is -1 and so on. Then use 0. Same as BCount.I can get the query of number 1 with this queryBut I'm confused on how to include the number 2-4 query.This is the output I wantAny ideas will be much appreciated. Thanks.
13245029	Hope this works for your case:I am not sure if you really need that where clause so I commented it out. And the value of TotalBPhase for Room Three on your result table should be 14, as can be seen from this SQL Fiddle demo.

The work-around would be another method which produces XML only and returns the Project object. I'd rather like to avoid duplicate code.I am on Spring 3.1.3-RELEASE.
13275802	According to Spring documentation, your produces param will return content based on the Accept, i.e.If the method takes in application/xml, the method will produce XML, if application/json, it will produce json, etc.You just need marshallers set up for the appropriate object types.Documentation here:()

Any pointers on where I am going wrong and how I can sort by the title would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks.
13277420	Usually something like this is achieved via a second array with $keyToSort =&gt; $id, sort this array via the standart sort functions or your own, then you have a conversion to your first arrayusing this, the depth of your array is limitless.
13277441	The second paramater to usort should be a function. See . You would need to pass it a function like:I think you would then call it like usort($restrictedEvents, "cmp");.
13279531	From Guru of the Week #2. We have the original function:I added dummy Employee class to that:And got compilation error:In place (1):In place (2):To eliminate first one, we change iterator to const_iterator. And the only way to eliminate second error, is to write own operator==. However, Herb Sutter wrote that: The Employee class isn't shown, but for this to work it must either have a conversion to string or a conversion ctor taking a string.But Employee has a conversion function and conversion constructor. GCC version 4.4.3. Compiled normally, g++ file.cpp without any flags.There should be implicit conversion and it should work, why it doesn't? I don't want operator==, I just want it work like Sutter said, with a conversion to string or a conversion ctor taking a string.
13279672	What happens when you reverse the operands of the comparison operators? The compiler complains that there is no operator == for List&lt;&gt;, but its defined for string.Changing if( *i == name ) to if( name == *i ) should work.
13279787	I believe the code is allowed to compile, but not required to. Remember that string is a typedef for basic_string&lt;char&gt;, it is not a class by itself. Minimal example:Yes, Employee is convertible to string, but it isn't really a string, so that is not good enough to determine which template argument to use for operator==.If an extra overload specifically for operator==(const string&amp;, const string&amp;) is added, it works, and another standard library implementation might provide just that overload. If it is provided, the code will compile, but it's an extension not required by standard C++.Edit: actually, as others have mentioned, that isn't quite enough (const issues), but even if fixing the other issues, this remains, and I believe this is the answer to your core question.

Its just that i keep hearing about Break; as being the easy way out and produces potential spaghetti code which hasn't happened here but still.Without the break the "Nothing sold in the last 2 weeks" would output the amount stored in the array.
13295033	I suspect you don't actually want to break here anyway. Surely you want to just keep going with the rest of the trees - just because you find one tree which doesn't match your condition (e.g. it's not been sold), does that really mean there can't be any matching ones later in your collection?Your method is distinctly strange anyway, in terms of being a get method which doesn't return anything, but adds values to an existing collection. That's the first thing I'd change.

13310316	I'm using the same while loop on two pages where the only difference is a different SQL call on each page. The first works as it should, grabbing the contents from the query and displaying it in an image slider:This works as it should stepping through the loop and grabbing the contents from the query so long as there are less than 52 entries returned, ending when each record has displayed once.Upon implementing the same while loop with a different SQL call, the problem occurs. Instead of grabbing from the array and ending the while loop when the contents have displayed once, it continues to loop the contents in the image slider until 52 entries have been displayed. So for instance, if the SQL call only finds 4 records to display in the image slider, the set of 4 displays 13 times (52/4) before ending the loop. Can anyone help me figure out how to end this loop after it has displayed each record from my database once and only once? Thanks in advance!
13310398	Major problems:1) Vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Enjoy having your server destroyed.2) Terminology: you're not fetching "from an array". You're fetching a row of data from a result set, returning that row AS an array.3) Your loop should terminate after 52 records OR no more records are avaialble, even though you're using some ugly syntax in the while() condition. Check that your query is actually fetching the right records, in the order/format you're expecting. There's nothing in your code that'd cause PHP to output "duplicate" rows.

13323846	I'm very new to data structures and I'd really like to know the opinion of the experienced heads here at SO. I have some data which is hierarchical, basically like a tree. I used to store it in ordered points (x,y) stored as arrays but now it's becoming increasingly cumbersome to do this. Let's say that I have two properties, on and off. For each property, I want to store 5 data values. But each of those data values has a corresponding data value which needs to be stored with it. I need to be able to plot these easily too.I thought of a dictionary of tuples but it doesn't really work too well, particularly when it comes to plotting the values easily. Any ideas?An example is this. Say I have 3 balls, of mass 5, 10 and 15kg. I throw each ball with a range of velocities, say 1m/s, 2m/s, 3m/s, 4m/s and 5m/s. I measure the height for each ball and each velocity. So each velocity point is coupled to the corresponding height.I used to store this in different arrays, say something like this:ball_5kg:ball_10kgbut I don't think if this is really ideal, or the best way to store this data, particularly when the number of ball masses and velocities get really large. Are there any better ways to store this?

13327448	Because that Unix time stamp is in milliseconds. You didn't specify milliseconds, so it is giving you exactly 10:43:09 on Jan 16, 1970. The other time stamp is giving you 10:43:09.395 on Jan 16, 1970.EDITThe Unix timestamp is the number of SECONDS since the Jan 1st, 1970. Javascript's getTime() returns the number of MILLISECONDS since Jan 1st, 1970. So yes it is the Unix timestamp... in milliseconds.
13327512	You are giving two different times to Date() and both of them are incorrect. Javascript's Date object accepts no argument for current time or milliseconds or date string or [year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds]."Fri Jan 16 1970 10:43:09 GMT-0500 (EST)" is invalid format for Date().

13332930	I’ve got a pyparsing issue that I have spent days trying to fix, with no luck. Here’s the relevant pseudocode:So, I’m trying to get a specific set of doctests to pass. But the tests in question update self.multilineCommands after instantiation. Although there are no issues setting the attribute correctly, self.grammar seems blind to the change, and fails the tests.However, if I set self.multilineCommands inside __init__(), then the tests all pass.How can I get self.grammar to stay up-to-date with self.multilineCommands?Follow-UpSo, part of the issue here is that I’m refactoring code I didn’t write. My experience with pyparsing is also exclusively limited to my work on this project. Pyparsing author Paul McGuire posted a helpful response, but I couldn’t get it to work. It could be an error on my part, but more likely the bigger issue is that I over-simplified the pseudo-code written above. So, I’m going to post the actual code.Warning!What you are about to see is uncensored. The sight of it might make you cringe…or maybe even cry. In the original module, this code was just a single piece of a total “god class”. Splitting out what is below into the Parser class is just step 1 (and apparently, step 1 was enough to break the tests).There you have it. The ugly truth. ☺ Edited 2012-11-12: I incorrectly used the term “class attribute” in the original title for this question. It‘s a silly mistake, and I apologize for any confusion. It has now been corrected to “instance attribute”.
13332992	If you want self.grammar to always be equal to self.multilineCommands it is as simple as:Then you could change either value and they will both be the same.
13333778	Define self.multilineCommands as a Forward, like this:and then define the rest of your grammar using self.multilineCommands as you would normally. In your tests, “inject” different expressions for self.multilineCommands using the &lt;&lt; operator:Then when you parse using the overall grammar, your pyparsing test expression will be used where ever self.multilineCommands is.(Note:Be sure to enclose the right-hand side in ()’s to guard against precedence of operations problems due to my unfortunate choice of &lt;&lt; for this operator. In the next release of pyparsing, I’ll add support for &lt;&lt;= and deprecate &lt;&lt; for this operation, which will resolve most of this problem.)EDITHere is a flexible parser that has a write-only property that will accept a list of strings to take as allowed keywords. The parser itself is a simple function call parser that parses functions that take a single numeric argument, or the constants pi or π or e.Now change the keywords by just assigning a word list to the keywords property. The setter method converts the list to a MatchFirst of Keywords. Note that now, parsing "sin(30)" will raise an exception:

When you call s.intern() the run-times looks for a copy of the string in a pool of interned strings, uses one if it's found, and makes one otherwise, so that there's only one copy of that string.

13346141	In theory the first, as you're making a single call. The second example you're calling the Parse method and then passing it the result of the ToString method. That being said, see some of the comments as to why there maybe better solutions (i.e. what if it fails).
13346161	For string Convert.ToDouble just checks value for null and return 0.0 if so. Then it really calls double.Parse:So I don't think that double.Parse if much faster for non-number types. But when you don't really know that type your argument is, it's better to call Convert.ToDouble(value) instead of double.Parse(value.ToString()).

Here is my problem/thought process:I want to make a "GameObject' base class that all other objects inherit from to lend to polymorphism.I want each inherited class to have a static data member list of vertexes to render the polygons.

13347840	If the GameObject is an interface, then you can enforce the existence of a static Property.Alternatively, you could just have the list of vertices as a protected data member in GameObject itself, and have the derived classes access it.
13348227	There is a single instance of a static class member declared in a base class for all descendants and the base class itself. Therefore a single list of vertices in a base class will not do.

If you want to add a leading zero, useYou can also use the formated output functionality with the %06d specifier, like this:6 means "use six digits"; '0' means "pad with zeros if necessary".

13363877	You can use Exception Handling to attempt to work around this problem - in particular, try and catch. That would be most effective if there are particular areas of the application that are fragile and that seem to break most often.But this might just be a symptom of a larger problem. If you find that your application is broken on a regular basis, the problem could lie with your development process. Perhaps you need to develop functional/unit tests, test your application more rigorously prior to deployment, understand why individual developers are not fixing their own mistakes (or "releasing" so many in the first place), etc.

13389306	So from reading/research about memory leaks it suggests to make all inner classes static to avoid memory leaks. However, by looking at the SDK samples (specifically TicTacToeLib) they implement their callbacks without the use of static inner classes. Will this cause a memory leak? If not, why?
13389698	I would approach it from the standpoint of what use case are you trying to solve, and not what the language itself is doing. If you "nested class" (not inner class because inner classes can't be static) needs to be able to call non-static methods on its parent class, or read non-static members, then you don't have much choice but to make it non-static. If you can get away with not accessing any of the parent class's non-static resources, then by all means do so (you'll save some memory that way anyways). However, if you're worried about memory leaks and you're going to make the nested class private as in your example, then you really shouldn't have anything to worry about because instances of that class can only be created locally to the parent class (unless you create a static member of the parent class that holds a reference to an instance of the nested class, in which case that object would be around until the parent class gets unloaded by the VM).In summary, I wouldn't personally worry too much about whether or not your nested class is declared as static or non-static, but focus more on the lifecycle of instances of that class, if you're worried about leaking memory.
13389748	Yes, this sample will cause a leak in case it keeps a Message in the queue. But it's not a very severe leak since it is usually limited to a rather short amount of time.But there is a rather simple way to prevent the leak:Put the following two classes into your projectAnd now you can use Handler / Callback almost as you used to do but it's no longer leaking.So either like or likeThe leak problem with Handler is that each Message / Runnable (which is actually wrapped in a Message) knows it's target, i.e. has a hard reference to the Handler or Callback. And if that target is a non-static inner class, it will have an implicit hard reference to the outer class which is typically an Activity.That means that as long as there are Messages enqueued for your Handler, your whole Activity can't be garbage collected.To solve this issue that chain of hard references from Message to Activity has to be broken. The SafeCallback class does exactly that by keeping just a WeakReference towards your Activity.That means, the Message has now a hard reference to SafeCallback but the part bind there can now be garbage collected. In case that happens Handler.Callback callback = mCallback.get(); will turn out null and the Message is simply discarded. There is no more useful target anyways. It is still leaking the SafeCallback itself but that's a pretty much empty class so it won't lead to problems.
13392038	Let's consider the package structure as below:myModule.py contains a single class such as:As you can see, there's nothing fancy, I'm just defining a list as a static class variable.Now let's consider the code from main.py:The issue is that in my code I'm importing twice the same class from the same module but in different ways: once as a an absolute import and once as a relative one. As seen in the last part of the code, even though the classes are the same, they are not equal because their module are being registered distinctively into the sys.modules:and as a result, their representation differs:So... is there any way to set this variable as static for good?Edit:The code above is a obviously only a reduction of my real problem. In reality, I basically have a piece of code that inspects all the modules recursively nested within a folder and that registers the classes contained in there. All the classes registered this way can then be instanciated using a common syntax such asThis is why I sometimes end up having 2 objects pointing to the same class but that have been imported in different ways. One has been imported automatically through a imp.load_module() call, and the other would have been directly imported by the user through a conventional import statement. If the user decides to manually import a class, he should still have access to the same static class variable than the one defined within the same but automatically registered class. Hope it makes sense?
13392127	No. (At least, not without very ugly and fragile hacks.) When you import it in those two different ways, the module is actually imported twice. Python usually re-uses an already-imported module if you import it again, but this is based not on the actual file imported, but on the path relative to sys.path. So if you import myModule.py once absolutely and once relatively, the whole file actually gets executed twice. You can see this if you do something like:You should see True for the first print (because the first two imports are via the same path) but False for the second (because the third import uses a different path). This is also why you're seeing the module with two entries in sys.modules.Because the whole module is imported twice, you actually have two different classes called MyClass, not one. There's no legitimate way to have those two classes share their state. It's just as if you'd imported two different classes from two different modules. Even though they happen to be defined in the same source file, they're not linked in any way when you double-import them like that. (There is an evil way to link them, which is that you can include code in your module to manually check if it's been imported under a different name, and then manually mess with sys.modules to set the currently-importing module to the already-imported one. But this is a bad idea, because it can be hard to tell if what's being imported is really the same module, and also because stomping on sys.modules can lead to strange bugs if either the original import or the new import failed for any reason.)The real question is, why are you importing the module twice? The second question is, why are you using relative imports at all? The solution is to just import the module once using absolute imports, and then you'll have no problems.
13392542	"static" variables in other languages have a lot to answer for when it comes to python. I too find that way of thinking makes my head hurt when it comes to this language.It's hard to tell what your ultimate goal is but it might be worth noting that you can make a 'static' variable - (|cough| a 'module' variable?) by declaring it in the module. So myModule might be structured something like:The modList is initialized on the import and should serve you as a singleton/static var. If you really want to mess with it directly I'm pretty sure you can even use it from myApp using the namespace myPackage.myModule.modList; but some accessors to formalize its use and purpose might be advisable.
13397041	I have two aggregate roots and two non aggregate root entities:I know, that the relation D -&gt; B breaks DDD principle.I heard, that in the most cases the solution is to make the referenced entity a new aggregate root.But is making B to a new aggregate root really an option if B is a real child of A (B can not live without A)?

13398115	I agree with you, sometimes it just doesn't make sense to separate one entity from its aggregate, because it fits so naturally in it. This is one of the reasons why I'm not totally sold on the "small aggregates" approach that some recommend.In such a case, what you can do is get a reference to B by traversal of an instance of A instead of getting it directly. After all, if B can't exist without A, there's no reason objects outside of the aggregate should know about a particular B and not know about its A.

13430045	First of all, this isn't DDD thinking, this is RDBMS thinking. In DDD you model business processes as they are in the real world, you don't have one-to-many etc concepts. So forget about DB, foreign keys and so on. What are your bounded contexts (BC)? Each aggregate is a BC itself so they can have different representation of the concepts EVEN if they are named the same.If I understand corerctly, it seems that A B C D are part of a single aggregate. That doesn't mean they are defined ONLY in that aggregate and ONLY in that form. However if C is a fully fledged AR in some other BC, it is quite possible that in THIS context to be represented only as an id or a few properties (interfaces are VERY handy for this stuff). So even if they are both named C, they are different, having only the behavior needed by a specific context. DDD works with a lot of BCs and the models are valid for one BC only. this means that in your app you would have multiple A ,B ,C definitions according to each BC and each definition might be slightly different. This means that there isn't really only one model suitable for all the cases (and I'm not talking about CQRS here, just DDD).I don't know much about the domain to actually come up with something more concrete. But simply put, try to represent things as they are and as they work in reality.

13459134	Not related to your question, but in the code snippet you posted you violate the Swing threading rules. All Swing components should only be accessed/modified from the Event Dispatch Thread. Modifying Swing components from your StoppableThread is not allowed and might result in weird behavior at runtime.After a quick glance on your code, it seems you could use a SwingWorker and fire progress events. More or less the same mechanism as illustrated in the JProgressBar tutorial (the part where they use a SwingWorker)Consult the Swing concurreny tutorial for more information.

13474195	Giving it a chance: there is a text appearance called actionMenuTextAppearance. Have you tried that?Update: I did some more digging and I believe that this file is the layout And there they refer to textAppearanceListItemSmall and textAppearanceSmall. However, it takes this value from a special theme which is specified as following in Theme.Holo.LightAnd like this in Theme.Holo:The problems comes from the fact that the parent of Sherlock.__Theme.DarkActionBar is Theme.Sherlock.Light. This is not valid for the dark action bar. Taking the line from Theme.Holo should do the trick.

Using C# .net, I would like to read these configurations, and use the Values in other portions of the code. My first thought is that I would use a string search to look for the Labels then parse out the values following the labels and add them to a dictionary, but this seems rather tedious considering the number of labels/values that I would have to search for. I am interested to hear some thoughts on a possible architecture to perform this task. I have included a small section of a sample text file that contains some of the labels and values (below). A couple of notes: The Values are not always numeric (as seen in the AUX Serial Number); For whatever reason, the text files were formatted using spaces (\s) rather than tabs (\t). Thanks in advance for any time you spend thinking about this.Sample Text:

It was a quick write-up based on my train of thought.

13483718	I think that due to the fact that Theme.Sherlock.Light.DarkActionBar don't style its contents right is due to the actionWidgetTheme attribute is used with a ContextThemeWrapper for inflating the action bar views (Jake Wharton's own words), thus something like the following (not tested) will be needed to fulfill your needs, though breaking your need of not using Theme.Sherlock as parent in one way:Might work or not work.

13499755	It doesn't work, because Object class has no such method as name(), and you are trying to invoke it on a reference of type Object.Just change the method signature to take Vendor reference as parameter: -Since your method name() is in Vendor class, and you are passing a reference of Vendor, so you don't need to use Object as formal parameter in your method.
13499769	IF you know o is a Vendor then cast it to type Vendor or rewrite the parameter type to just be Vendor instead of the generic Object in the method definition

13520743	According to Wikipedia, an important choice when making a suffix tree implementation is the parent-child relationships between nodes. The most common one is using linked lists called sibling lists.How does this work in Java?
13520813	Parent has a list of child nodes (either as array, double linked list or so)Each child has a link to its parent. Traversing is extremely simple as you don't need a stack.
13521545	In a sibling list, each node has exactly two references: first-child and next-sibling. This lets you iterate over all the children of a node by starting with first-child, and then following next-sibling until you get to the child whose next-sibling is null. I don't see why Java would be any different from any other programming language.It's interesting to note that this representation is virtually identical to the standard representation of a binary tree, where left is spelled first-child and right is spelled next-sibling. This demonstrates the 1-1 relationship between binary trees and general trees with the same number of nodes. (It might seem contradictory at first, but note that a binary tree may have only a left child, or only a right child, and those are considered different. By contrast, in a general tree, there is only one way for a node to have one child.

13536262	I am working on simple templating enging for my work in javascript.. it needs to be very simple so i am not using Handlebars, moustache or any other robust templating engine available.I keep reading the word 'PRECOMPILE' or 'COMPILE' template to boost performance. But i am not sure what exactly then mean by that. In my work i cache the template html in my object to avoid hitting the template html everytime.It's a very simple function which mainly does the following item is the object which holds the value to be replaced.Can someone please tell me what exactly it means when they(handlebars etc) say compile the template. ?
13536311	Update: I'm incorrect here, see comment below.Well let's say my template is a sentence with fill in the blanks:One day, ____ decided he was going to bring _____ with him to the _____.Compiling the template would be filling in the blanks.On day, JOHN decided he was going to bring SALLY with him to the BATMAN PREMIER.Hope metaphor is helpful in this case : )
13536328	Underscore, Handlebars, and most other JS templates create a function out of the template string. You can then call the function multiple times with different arguments and get the appropriate string of HTML. (I believe both Underscore and Handlebars do this by parsing the template string into JS code and then calling the Function constructor to make the compiled template function.)When these libraries talk about "precompiling", they mean the initial step of turning the template string into a reusable function. This can be a somewhat heavy step, but it makes rendering the template much faster (faster than simple regex substitution in most cases) so it's more efficient to create the function from the template code and then use it multiple times, rather than recompiling and rendering every time the template is called.
13536771	My program connects to a server, the public key of the server is already known. The program then encrypts a AES key together with an initialization vector, and sends it to the server. The server decrypts the message and from now on AES is used to encrypt the conversation.My question is about how to generate the IV. If I go the naive way and seed a pseudo random generator with the current time, an attacker could probably make a few very good guesses about the IV, which is of curse not what I want.As hardware random generators are not only slow, but also not available everywhere, I'd like to go for a different approach. When the client program is first started, I let the user make a few random mouse moves, just like TrueCrypt does. I now save those "random bits" created by the mouse movement and when I need a generator, I'll use them as a seed. Of course, the random bits have to get updated every time I use them as seed. And this is my question: I thought about just saving the first few random bits generated as the new "random bits". (So they get used to initialize the random engine next time the software starts.) Now I'm not sure if this would be random enough or if pseudo random generators would show guessable patterns here. (I'd probably use std::mt19937 )Edit: The chaining mode changes, so I want it to work for the mode with the "highest" requirements. Which would be CBC if I remember correctly.Please note: The software I'm writing is purely experimental.
13539873	Pseudo-random generators are nice for things where you don't want users to be able to predict the outcome (such as dice rolls in games), but worthless for cases where you don't want a computer to be able to compute it. For cryptography, don't use pseudo-randomness at all.If you want randomness, you need actual random data. As you write, mouse movements are a good source for that. Given that you don't talk about /dev/random, I take it you're running on Windows, which unfortunately doesn't gather randomness while running. So you will have to do this yourself. Depening on the use case, you can run a randomness daemon at startup which keeps gathering random data and allows your program to retrieve it when it is needed, or you can ask the user to make some mouse movements when your program starts.Or you can decide that if Windows doesn't want you to have real random data, you don't want to use Windows, but I suppose that's not an option. ;-)
13540825	Use a cryptography PRNG, just like you do for the key.On windows use CryptGenRandom/RtlGenRandom and on Linux/Unix use /dev/urandom. Those get seeded by the OS, so you don't need to take care of it.If you really want to create your own PRNG, look into Fortuna. Don't use a Mersenne twister.

13558834	I know the stl priority queue uses make_heap, push_heap, and pop_heap to manage the underlying stl container (a vector, for example).Are the elements' copy constructors being called when moving elements around during the make_heap, push_heap, and pop_heap calls?
13558906	Although this is implementation-dependant, most sensible implementations will use std::swap to move elements around, therefore avoiding copying overhead.
13568441	According to the standard, push_heap and make_heap require the value type (*iterator) to be MoveAssignable and MoveConstructible; pop_heap and sort_heap also require the iterator type to be ValueSwappable, which requires swap to work, which also requires the value type to be MoveAssignable and MoveConstructible.My interpretation is that the standard library can only invoke operations which can be satisfied with move semantics, which could be tested by trying it on a container whose value type's copy constructor and copy assignment operator have been deleted.By way of a quick verification, I tried the heap functions on a datatype whose move constructor and move assignment operator were deleted. Both gcc 4.7.2 and clang 3.2 generated compile-time errors complaining that the move operations were deleted. The test with deleted copy operations compiled just fine.

13574542	This problem seems directly related to the infamous 2GB limit and I'm not sure at this atge if its a 32bit PHP issue.I've seen the comments related to HTTP not being designed for such large files.However, I would rather exhaust this direction before deciding on any fundamental change to what has been proven to work so far.As the title suggest I need to upload >2GB files, largest so far 3.8GB.I have a form built using jQuery-file-upload which has had no problems sending any files (all less &lt;2GB) until these large ones started.The 3.8GB one takes maybe 5 minutes to upload from File-Upload and the progress bar completes to 100%.However the reported error after upload is a type 1 which suggests the file size limit has been breached.If I monitor the disk usage on the server during upload it will have the following sample properties:Before upload the disk is 30% used, as the upload continues this usage increases, 31%,32%....45%,46%etc.However at around the 2GB point the disk usage drops back to 30% while the client/browser File-Upload continues.When the servers disk usage stops increasing the client may only be at 60% of the upload.Yet the client still continues to 100% but isn't being accepted by the server as the disk status never moves off 30%.I'm running 64Bit Ubuntu (latest) with Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu) and PHP Version 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.2After many days on and off searching for a solution I still cannot get the 3.8GB file to upload after changing so many settings.I'll list the sort of changes below but at this stage I think it may be a 32bit PHP issue so if anyone can suggest a link worth following or solution worth trying I'd appreciate it.In Apache2 I've set the following:In php.ini I've set the following:If I run the following on the server it would seem the PHP does not have a 32bit issue but I'm not sure at this stage.As I mentioned any ideas would be greatly appreciated.UPDATE:Have solved this issue, so thanks to @BogdanBurim for suggesting the back to basics approach:I have managed to upload a 3.8 GB file over HTTP with the following settings:In Apache2 I've set the following:In php.ini I've set the following:The only other important part of this solution was having to remove the MAX_FILE_SIZE, HTML from the upload form:Having this set continually caused a PHP type 2 error, so php couldn't handle the greater than 32bit integer that is set.Removing it caused PHP type 1 errors until I changed the UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE to 0 everywhere and hey presto it now works!!!!
13574691	The question is why would you use your browser to upload > 1GB. Consider top file sharing services most limit file upload size to 1GB via browser. What happens if user-download fails you would have to restart the whole process. Have you looked in to alternatives if you have such large file uploads, torrents, ftp or personal upload client like rapidshare, fileupload, megaupload etc. Have. You are limited because of the file size limit set to POST's. If you are determined to use HTTP to upload bigger files which i would discourage, the optimal solution would be spliting the file and uploading the smaller splited parts then reassembling the file.
13583415	I'm using simple links for an admin panel but in case of user accidently clicks on link for user deletion, there should be a confirmation pop-up for avoding this.Probably as you know a href tag's are not fully compatible with javascript. So, i have used span tag for "onclick" but that didn't went so well:Here is the html code for link:
13583448	Try......instead.You need to return the value of your method, and returning false in an onclick event prevents the default behaviour (which in this case would be to navigate to the href).

13586726	The problem I am facing is as following. I have a source document, src.pdf. I need to insert the contents of src.pdf into target.pdf, rotated by n degrees, where n is NOT a multiple of 90. Any help would be appreciated, thanks. EDIT 1:PDF contains no annotations. I can use any solution which relies on utilities, or write my own code, preferably in C#/Python/Ruby/Perl, but not limited to a language. The platform is Windows Server 2008 R2, I prefer to stick to the existing server but Linux is also an option. Latest (stable) GhostScript and pdftk are already installed.
13586876	Look into itextsharp which is a library in C# to manipulate pdf files. You can do this task programmatically. The same library is available in Java too.

13586937	You missed semi-colons ;Note: Always format your code neatly. Don't write all codes in one line, it will confuse you.
13586982	Semicolons are not optional. The browser will try to insert them as best it can, but it can be wrong a lot of the time.Additionally, use a @!#$ array! That's what they're there for!Try this:And remove the form. You are not submitting anything, so you don't need a form.
13589329	If a new language is not a problem, LateX could be an option. You can include a pdf as a figure in a tex file, and you will be able to use dedicated option like rescaling and rotating function. Then, compile it to obtain a new pdf.The very simple following code works for me :From this pdf:I get this new one:It will however need some manual ajustements to get exactly what you want...
13593806	I've seen instances where malloc fails because the pointer itself which will point to the new memory is itself not allocated:If for some reason pNewNode needed to be previously created or allocated, it's invalid and malloc will fail since the result of the malloc allocation (which is itself successfull) can't be stored in the pointer. When this bug is present, I've seen that running the same program multiple times, the code will work in some (when the pointer is accidentally present, but just by sheer luck), but in many of the cases it will point nowhere since it was never allocated.How to find this bug? In your debugger look at whether pNewNode is actually valid before the call to malloc. it should be pointing to 0x000000 or some other real location (which is actually garbage until the malloc assigns an actual allocated memory segment).
13594899	I have an array named 'ArrayA' and it is full of ints but I want to add another 5 cell to the end of the array every time a condition is met. How would I do this? ( The internet is not being very helpful )
13594980	If this is a static array, you will have to create a new one with more space and copy the data yourself. If it was allocated with malloc(), as the title to your question suggests, then you can use realloc() to do this more-or-less automatically. Note that the address of your array will, in general, have changed.It is precisely because of the need for "dynamic" arrays that grow (and shrink) as needed, that languages like C++ introduced vectors. They do the management under the covers.
13595220	In a modern OS it is generally safe to assume that if you allocate a lot of memory that you don't use then it will not actually consume physical RAM, but only exist as virtual mappings. The OS will provide physical RAM as soon as a page (today generally in chunks of 4Kb) is used for the first time.You can specifically enforce this behavior by using mmap to create a large anonymous mapping (MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS) e.g. as much as you intend to hold at maximum. On modern x64 systems virtual mappings can be up to 64Tb large. It is logically memory available to your program, but in practice pages will be added to it as you start using them.realloc as described by the other posters is the naiive way to resize a malloc mapping, but make sure that realloc was successful. It can fail!Problems with memory arise when you use memory once, don't deallocate it and stop using it. In contrast allocated, but untouched memory generally does not actually use resources other then VM table entries.
13595248	It sounds like the user got a low-memory warning. UINavigationControllers will retain their views, whereas tabbed ones will pop off the invisible ones. However, the low memory code is still getting called. Check your warning handlers prior to reaching that spot. Also, test by hitting "Simulate Memory Warning" under the hardware menu at all entry and exit points. shows a mess of what happens when you don't.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/14225-uinavigationcontrollers-and-didreceivememorywarning.html has a nice comment or so on how to handle this.I'm betting your view controller loads something and caused the memory warning. Ensure the user can't just stack tons of items on top of each other, and make sure your app is profiled to remove as many leaks as necessary to keep the app up.The above may not be on the mark, but should be related.Final note, don't use ARC. Something that disallows calling superclass functions is bound to screw up. If you understand bridging Core Foundation, then perhaps ARC is fine. I personally avoid it at all costs b/c memory becomes randomly handled by Apple's under-the-hood. I've seen their stuff fail way too much
13600430	I am creating a function which has a for loop that runs through each tag in a specific div. for example, here would be the div:is there a "for each tag in x" kind of function in javascript that would allow me to loop through it? keep in mind that I can't do this in jquery and each tag will likely be different, as shown above.
13600495	If you want all elements that are contained within a div (including children of children, etc...) and you want only elements (not other types of nodes) and you want it to work in all browsers then you can use getElementsByTagName("*") like this:document.getElementById('container') is just some means to get the container element - you can use any method that is appropriate to get the containing parent element.getElementsByTagName("*") can take a wildcard as shown so it returns all elements contained within the node and it can be called on any element to retrieve elements only from within that containing element.

13607220	Be sure to run this code only after the HTMLDivElement has been added to the DOM:Following a chat with the author, it became evident the problem was with the Brightcove Video Player loading new elements to reflect a playlist of videos. The clear solution as this point was to tie into the event-system of Brightcove's player to respond after their elements have been added.
13607268	You need to use .text()The .text() function is actually pretty smart. You can pull the text out of an object and jQuery will know what you want.

13622040	I am tring to plot a map with d3.js using GeoJSON, but the paths generated look like this:the code and data are in this Gist:https://gist.github.com/4157853I can load the data just fine on QGIS.Does any one know what is causing this?
13622332	If the code you posted in the gist is everything you're trying to run, then the data you show in data.json is not being loaded anywhere. Anyway, your draw function is acting on the data defined by the variable map (line 16), which refers to a simulation variable which isn't set anywhere. And even if it did, line 34 then refers to a features property of the object passed in as json, which map does not have.In summary, you need to pass the JSON you posted in the gist to your draw function. Then it might well work. If you don't pass in valid data to the d3 SVG helpers, you'll get a bunch of NaN out.

13644941	You need to put different format for each column here. Simply try CSS
13644989	You need to set the css for all the list items in the widest column. First you have to identify the widest column, then return it with the max width, then use it as part of the selector.Here is a demonstration:

13648322	Yes, you can compile the code, but you can not run it. In order to run the code, you need to specify the run-time environment.

13651746	There is several issues with this code.First of all you should use EventHandler built-in delegate for defining events. Second, you can't raise an event outside the class that defines it (that's why you can't use your Notify() from the descendants). Third, you can use Template Method Design Pattern and define contract between your base class and it descendants more clearly and implement one part of the threashold check.And finally I don't understand at all why you need inheritance hierarchy at all? Maybe you can implement all required logic in one class? But anyway here code that would compile and behave correctly:

13713788	Please consider the following two structures:Ideally, I would be able to initialize a container something like this: My compiler says: "error: too many initializers"
13714036	ISO/IEC 9899:2011 §6.7.2.1 Structure and union specifiers 3 A structure or union shall not contain a member with incomplete or function type (hence, a structure shall not contain an instance of itself, but may contain a pointer to an instance of itself), except that the last member of a structure with more than one named member may have incomplete array type; such a structure (and any union containing, possibly recursively, a member that is such a structure) shall not be a member of a structure or an element of an array.  18 As a special case, the last element of a structure with more than one named member may have an incomplete array type; this is called a flexible array member. In most situations, the flexible array member is ignored. In particular, the size of the structure is as if the flexible array member were omitted except that it may have more trailing padding than the omission would imply. However, when a . (or ->) operator has a left operand that is (a pointer to) a structure with a flexible array member and the right operand names that member, it behaves as if that member were replaced with the longest array (with the same element type) that would not make the structure larger than the object being accessed; the offset of the array shall remain that of the flexible array member, even if this would differ from that of the replacement array. If this array would have no elements, it behaves as if it had one element but the behavior is undefined if any attempt is made to access that element or to generate a pointer one past it.The trouble is that you cannot embed a structure with a flexible array member into an an aggregate (array, or another structure, or a union). You can have pointers to such structures, but not instances of such structures.
13714052	That's not supported by the language, like pointed in the comments, the array member without anything into the brackets ( [] ) is a flexible array.You can do this: But you can't do it with struct, also note that sizeof(container_t) would return an undefined value, so you can't do this.Go around this by using pointers instead: But now your struct isn't a whole chuck of memory, and you can't access to it like an unique block.So you could instead use a fixed dimension for arrays (i.e.: part_t parts[2]).Also, you can't copy the struct, you need to copy all it's members.So with memcpy(&amp;str1,&amp;str2,sizeof(container_t)) you copy just the struct field, thus just pointers.And that memory is in the stack, so never do this: In this case use malloc instead.

Plus, while a shared shortcode (like TextMark's) would be great, a full number would be ok.

13763473	In jQuery UI 1.9+, extending a widget is done in the same manner as creating a new widget. The widget factory ($.widget()) supports a few scenarios:Creating a new widget using the base widget ($.Widget) as the starting point:$.widget( "ns.widget", { ... } )Creating a new widget that inherits from an existing widget:$.widget( "ns.widget", $.ns.existingWidget, { ... } )Extending a widget:$.widget( "ns.widget", $.ns.widget, { ... } )You'll notice that the extending syntax and the inheritance syntax are the same. The widget factory is smart enough to notice that the widget you're creating and the widget you're inheriting from are the same and handle it appropriately.When inheriting or extending a widget, you only need to define what you want to change or add. There are also a few new methods that exist on the base widget to make it easier to work with inheritance and methods that change context. Read the jQuery.Widget documentation for a full list of methods and their descriptions. You'll definitely want to read about _super() if you're extending a widget.Here's an example that would change the default delay option to 500 and add a new option prefix which is added to all suggestions:

13783404	Both methods return equal results. Of course, -[NSObject isEqual:] doesn't compare the pointers of objects, it somehow check the inner fields or whatever. So what's the point of using exactly -[NSNumber isEqualToNumber:] to compare two NSNumbers?
13783465	-[NSObject isEqual:] checks if the two objects have the pointer address and hash whilst -[NSNumber isEqualToNumber:] checks if the values are the same.NSNumbers that are equal values have the same pointer address.
13783467	From the docs: Two NSNumber objects are considered equal if they have the same id values or if they have equivalent values (as determined by the compare: method). This method is more efficient than compare: if you know the two objects are numbers.So it handles id equals and number comparison.

13795028	Yes, you should - mostly because your design is an anti pattern. While the performance impact is low on read, you totally destroy either transactional integrity OR performance on the write / update side.Point is - in order to make updates across multiple repositoies then you need either DTC (slow), or make it repository by repository, which has no transactional integrity.Yo also are terribly slow for any select operation that cross references entities. And you ahve a maintenance nightmare.companyRepository.GetById(20);Should be repository.Element&lt;Company&gt;.Where (x =&gt; x.id=20);This approach would allow you to:Use one repository for everything.Use Company flexible, including join operation and subselectsUse one repository with one connection for all updates in a transaction without DTC.Right now your problem is not so much the opening, but the updates and the transaction.This is an / the approach that is used by Entity Framework etc. - if you want performance, raw, you can use BlToolkit.

This way you canCreate a background NSOperationQueue;If your download permits a certain reasonable number of simultaneous downloads, you can set maxOperationCount (or if you want serial, set this to 1).As you initiate your background jobs, you can create NSOperation objects, or just submit directly to the NSOperationQueue with blocks via addOperationWithBlock. You might need to do the former if you want to enjoy the ability to check the isCancelled flag.Each operation can check to see if it's cancelled before trying to update the view controller.When the view controller is dismissed, it can perform a simple cancelAllOperations to cancel everything that is queued up.Here's a random example:

13863316	A byte can be converted to a float as it will fit within the type, but going the other way cannot be done with an implicit conversion - a float may be far too big to fit into a byte, therefore an Array.Copy will never work in this scenario.

13863667	I am working on translating a system from python to c++. I need to be able to perform actions in c++ that are generally performed by using Python's struct.unpack (interpreting binary strings as numerical values). For integer values, I am able to get this to (sort of) work, using the data types in stdint.h:This works properly for little-endian binary strings, but fails on big-endian binary strings. Basically, I need an equivalent to using the &gt; tag in struct.unpack:Please note, if there is a better way to do this, I am all ears. However, I cannot use c++11, nor any 3rd party libraries other than Boost. I will also need to be able to interpret floats and doubles, as in struct.unpack("&gt;f", str) and struct.unpack("&gt;d", str), but I'll get to that when I solve this.NOTE I should point out that the endianness of my machine is irrelevant in this case. I know that the bitstream I receive in my code will ALWAYS be big-endian, and that's why I need a solution that will always cover the big-endian case. The article pointed out by BoBTFish in the comments seems to offer a solution.
13864200	If your as received values are truly strings, (char* or std::string) and you know their format information, sscanf(), and atoi(), well, really ato() will be your friends. They take well formatted strings and convert them per passed-in formats (kind of reverse printf).
13864257	For 32 and 16-bit values:This is exactly the problem you have for network data, which is big-endian. You can use the the ntohl to turn a 32-bit into host order, little-endian in your case.  The ntohl() function converts the unsigned integer netlong from network byte order to host byte order.This will also take care of the case where your host is big-endian and won't do anything.For 64-bit values Non-standardly on linux/BSD you can take a look at 64 bit ntohl() in C++?, which points to htobe64 These functions convert the byte encoding of integer values from the byte order that the current CPU (the "host") uses, to and from little-endian and big-endian byte order.For windows try: How do I convert between big-endian and little-endian values in C++?Which points to _byteswap_uint64 and as well as a 16 and 32-bit solution and a gcc-specific __builtin_bswap(32/64) call.Other SizesMost systems don't have values that aren't 16/32/64 bits long. At that point I might try to store it in a 64-bit value, shift it and they translate. I'd write some good tests. I suspectt is an uncommon situation and more details would help.

I understand that a VARCHAR(200) column containing 10 characters takes same amount of space as a VARCHAR(20) column containing same data. I want to know if changing a dozen VARCHAR(200) columns of a specific table to VARCHAR(20) would make the queries run faster, especially when:These columns will never contain more than 20 charactersThese columns are often used in ORDER BY clauseThese columns are often used in WHERE clauseSome of these columns are indexed so that they can be used in WHERE clausePS: I am using SQL Server 2000 but will upgrade to later versions of SQL anytime soon.
13894608	Size matters  Always use the smallest data size that will accommodate the largest possible value. If a column is going to store values between 1 and 5, use tinyint instead of int.   This rule also applies to character columns. The smaller the data size, the less there is to read, so performance, over all, benefits. In addition, smaller size reduces network traffic. With newer technology, this tip seems less relevant, but don’t dismiss it out of hand. You’ll won’t regret being efficient from the get-go.For more info visit

You can reproduce it with the following simple example.1.Create two tables:2. Fill both of them with some data:3. Execute the following queries with "include actual execution plan":If you inspect execution plans of these queries, you can see that estimated IO cost and estimated CPU cost is very different:

13897376	Actually to get an empty std::string, you just writestd::string's default constructor will give you an empty string without further prompting.As an aside, using NULL in C++ is generally discouraged, the recommendation would be to either use 0 (which NULL tends to be defined to anyway) or if you have a modern enough compiler, nullptr.
13897389	Let's break down what you are in fact doing:First you execute string a. This creates a new object on the stack, with default value (an empty string). Then you execute a=NULL, which calls the assignment function of the string class. But what is NULL? NULL in C++ is macro expanded into just 0. So you are attepting to assign an integer to a string variable, which of course is not possible.works, because you want to assign a char array, and the string class has the assignment operator method overloaded for char arrays, but not for integers. That's why NULL doesn't work and "abc" works.

13908513	Yes, using LIKE with a leading wildcard forces it to do a table-scan, i.e. reads every row in the table. The bigger the table, the slower it will be. For example, it can be hundreds or thousands of times slower!This is one of several reasons why storing comma-separated lists in a VARCHAR, and expecting to access individual elements, is a bad design for a relational database.See also my answer to Is storing a comma separated list in a database column really that bad?What you should do instead is define your OrderList table to store one pair of email and productid. If the order consists of several products, you have to store multiple rows. But it means you can always find the single product you're looking for, count how many people bought that product, etc. and you can make those queries fast by defining indexes.The rule against storing lists in a single column is called First Normal Form.

Input format:The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array. This is followed by a single line containing N integers separated by a single space with no leading/trailing spacesOutput format:A single integer that denotes the number of distinct ascending triples present in the arrayConstraints:N &lt;= 10^5Every value in the array is present at most twiceEvery value in the array is a 32-bit positive integerSample input:Sample output:Explanation:The distinct triplets areAnother test case:Input:Output:I tried to solve using DP. But out of 15 test cases only 7 test cases passed.Please help solve this problem.
13929130	Do you care about complexity?Is the input array sorted?if you don't mind about complexity you can solve it in complexity of N^3.The solution with complexity N^3:If it not sorted, then sorted the array.Use 3 for loops one inside the other and go threw the array 3 times for each number.Use hash map to count all the triples. The key will be the triple it self and the value will be the number of occurences.It should be something like this:Result = number of triples in the hash;I didn't try it but I think it should work.

13933754	I am new to the field. This question may be silly. NSDateFormatter is giving one year ahead date for 12/30/2012 and for 12/31/2012. For 12/30/2013 and 12/31/2013 it will also push the year out to 2014.My code is:How can I get it to give me the right date?
13933839	The format should be as follows.The supplied date format should be @"MM-dd-yyyy"You have to use MM only as per the date format.
13934077	As you are not giving the formatter informations about the timezone, the NSDateFormatter assume the dates as GMT-times. You need to set the correct timezone — either to the dateFormatter or add it to the string.. There are hundreds of post about this on Stack Overflow.

13939839	IF you want to take an arbitrary value for the Title field, or if they are all the same, you could do a MIN() on that column. MIN will omit nulls.

13940119	True, this is rather annoying but.. don't despair just yet - you can fix it with simple javascript: In short, this allows you to receive dragend event only once per second. Make sure your script doesn't die in the middle of your logic or that first will be the last drag. You can use try/catch/finally to overcome that. Enjoy!
13962586	You should note that you only need to know the number of elements that are smaller/larger than a particular element to know how many triples it serves as the middle point for. Using this you can calculate the number of triples quite easily, the only remaining problem is to get rid of duplicates, but given that you are limited to at most 2 of the same element, this is trivial. I solved using a Binary Index Tree . I also did a small write up, .
13966125	I have this HTML:This is my jQuery code:And finally my CSS:When I hover the link, the image correctly displays so its working. The problem is that when I click on it, it does not anymore trigger the click event. However if I remove the mouseenter/hover mechanism. The click event works fine. How is it possible to have the click event fire when the user mouse over the link? Probably I miss something important in my code. Thanks for any tips.UPDATE: I have successfully combined the three events in one function but I'm still using LIVE and IF/else because for some reason ON won't work. Anyway, I have mouseenter and mouseleave working correctly in the logic below. But click still won't work when mouseenter is activated. Probably I need to find a way that the click event will fire when the hover or mouseenter event is still shown.
13966155	Bind them at the same time and then check which event it is.
13966202	Try a more modern approach, using on() and creating the elements with jQuery:FIDDLElive() is deprecated, and you should be using on(). It's also pretty clear from the code that everytime the link is hovered, a new element is created, then it's hidden when the mouse leaves, not removed, so you're creating a bunch of elements, one everytime the link is hovered, without ever removing them. You should probably replace hide() with remove().

13971728	I am required to develop a program that takes as input a text file (java source code) and checks the codes against the syntax rules for java. Following that, the program should underline the SYNTAX errors present in the original source code and provide a new version of the code with the errors solved. I've done my research work and I came across the BNF for java jar. The BNF for java has been pretty much designed to satisfy my current requirements. It contains the rules for the java language and stuff but i have no idea of how to use it. I have vainly tried to look for some online tutorials. Can anyone guide me or tell me where to start? Any useful links??
13972009	Does this code snippet help you? This using existing getSystemJavaCompiler() in Java
13972124	As for the first part (detecting and underlining syntax errors), this is what the standard javac compiler does. You can invoke the compiler either command-line and parse the result, or programatically through the javax.tools.JavaCompiler included in the standard java runtime. Or you could just use any of the existing IDE environments out there (Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ).The second part ("...provide a new version of the code with the errors solved") is a lot trickier. To begin with, it implies that your system already knows what the end-result should be. Otherwise, many (if not most) syntax errors are ambiguous enough that attempting to automatically resolve them throws you way beyond mere development and into advanced realms of computer science and artificial intelligence.

The problem i don't know the most correct way. By far I did next:protected Boolean doInBackground(Object... param). And then convert param[0],param [1] to different type. I think it is a bad way.Using javatuples library for this purpose:protected Void doInBackground(Pair&lt;String, LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;... params)It seems too complex and redundant code.

14001641	@Sra's comment is the most appropriate response here. Regarding 'single page applications' then can certainly be used for larger scale projects, but careful management of code and the DOM is needed. I think you might need to provide a bit more information about how you're planning to do things and what you're worried about.Ext offers a client side MVC implementation but this does tend to centre around the single page application model. What this means is that you write your models, views and controllers and let your app decide which to render. The app is responsible for creating and disposing of client side controller and view instances, and the models really just exist to validate data and provide a sensible mechanism for sending / retrieving data from the server side.If you're wanting to use a typical server side MVC implementation e.g. ASP.NET MVC, then it should be noted that unless the app is massive, you'll probably just end up with a single .NET 'view', this view will contain your entire ExtJS app.You 'can' if you want, create a series of mini apps via Ext and render those in several server side views, but you will end up with a lot of duplicated (or shared) code which may well be a pain to manage.So to sum up, yes, you can use Ext for larger applications, yes you can use MVC (both client and server side) and finally yes, your front end will likely form a single page application.
14001927	You need to add the relevant namespaces in the web.config file in the Views folder, not in the main web.config file in the top folder. Just read the instructions carefully.
14004972	I'm currently improving my own MVC and I can't find a nice solution for the following scenario:In most of my models I'm working with a few (already validated by another model) user-based inputs and need to pass them from the controller (where I basically tell the models what to do with the input) to the various models of course. At the moment I'm putting every single user input into a property:Eventually when I need a new model to do something, I call it like this:And finally in the model I receive the input / variables by putting them in the models properties…That way I never have to think about where a variable comes from (after the user input has been validated, I don't really care anymore) and can always write a for me clean to read version of $this-&gt;user_inputBut I somehow have the feeling that this is not the easiest way and propably not a good one either. What bothers me the most is that when writing a new class/model, I always have to tell the model to take the input into their own property and I always have to pass parameters when calling a new class.Is there some way where I can just inherit these variables from the user when a new class is getting called without having the controller to be a parent class - or would this actually make sense to make the controller a parent? I think it would be confusing when another controller uses the model.
14005061	would this actually make sense to make the controller a parent?Yes, that is probably exactly how I would do it. Then you can use protected for the properties you want to share/inherit.

14007943	Use mysql_real_escape_string (or whatever escaping function comes with your library) instead of addslashes.Don't use stripslashes, because they have already been stripped by having been parsed by MySQL, and you run the risk of erasing legitimate backslashes in the input.For the collation, use whatever you like. I prefer latin_general_ci, but if you want unicode you should use a UTF8-compatible collation.

14010151	Note: The following does not intend to reflect a negative opinion of either ServiceStack or KendoUI. They are both amazing. These products are just incompatible by nature. The intended purpose of this question was to investigate the feasibility of this natureAfter looking through the source-code of Kendo.Mvc in detail, I've concluded that Kendo.Mvc is not suitable and undesirable for use with ServiceStack Razor.This is because:ServiceStack's Razor has no dependency on System.Web.Mvc and Kendo.Mvc reintroduces itServiceStack has its own implementation of classes like HtmlHelper, ViewPage and other key classes that Kendo.Mvc rely on the System.Web.Mvc equivalent of.I am yet to find a clear way to easily separate the Kendo.Mvc's dependency on MVC Controllers (which ServiceStack razor views do not use).

Can you all help me out ???
14023027	A very easy way, but maybe not the cleanest way you could do this:Enable Cash On Delivery for the store. Hide it from the front end using CSS.Using CSS to achieve this would hide the option from the general public, but would not prevent a web developer who is knowledgable with CSS to go find it and place a cash on delivery order - though I cant think of any reason someone would purposely do this since they won't achieve much by placing the order.EDIT : To hide Cash On Delivery add this to your CSS:
14023210	There are a number of ways to achieve this, but they require a familiarity with the Magento ecosystem. I would discourage using CSS to hide it from the end user, because someone that was slightly knowledgeable about CSS could easily unhide it and gain free access to purchase your products.I also suggest not override core files (even if you are not editing them), as that will cause upgrade problems in the future.The solid way:My favorite method would be to enable to Check/Money order method, and create yourself a small module, like this.

14049292	What is the difference between clickable and focusable in android?
14049319	Clickable means that it can be clicked by a pointer device or be tapped by a touch device. Focusable means that it can gain the focus from an input device like a keyboard. Input devices like keyboards cannot decide which view to send its input events to based on the inputs itself, so they send them to the view that has focus.
14049337	Focusable means ACTION_UP event will occur. It will gain it and it won't release it.Clickable means ACTION_UP first and ACTION_DOWN at the end. It will gain and release it at the end.

14052720	I struggled forever with the same problem. I had image .png files in the project that could not be added to version control ("add" button dimmed out), but found a solution.This was because of the method I used to add the files to the project. Like yours, they were in a group folder in the XCode tree. I had made a real folder with the same name on the disk, put the files there, then added them to the group folder using the "Add Files..." popup menu, without clicking "copy files to destination". They were added to the group, but to my dismay, without any option to add them to version control afterwards! The issue is, if you bring files in that way, XCode doesn't think it "owns" the files. It just linked to them. It won't let you do version control.Here is how to fix it:Associate the group folder (in XCode project tree) with the real folder on the disk: Select the XCode group folder, open the file inspector in the right pane, and click on the super small icon that looks like a little window, just below and to the right of the "Relative to Group". In the popup, navigate to your real folder. This will associate the group with the real folder location on disk. Now whatever you put in that group, XCode will ask you to copy in the real disk folder (and vice versa, whatever you put in the disk folder shows up in the XCode group).Get rid of the old file links. In Finder, drag all the files out of the folder that you could not add to version control to another location (e.g. desktop). Now go back to XCode, and delete all the old files references (now showing red) in your group folder.Now add the files back into XCode the correct way. Right click the group, click Add Files..., and navigate to the files you just moved. Or just drag all the files back from finder on the XCode group folder. Make sure you check "copy items to destination..." in the popup that appears. This time files will be copied to your associated folder on the disk, and XCode knows it owns them. The files can now be added to source control. You can delete your extra copies on the desktop.

14058679	I wrote a "push server" that, when a client opens a connection, it remains open while the server writes to the stream. I would like to know how to write a client in Java that reacts to commands as it recieves them through this infinite lengthed response.The problem is I have no idea where to start. If you could point me in the direction of a class where I could read the Javadoc, that would be great. I would like it to be able to respond instantly, so threads are probably a must.Thank you so so much for any help!Edit: By infinite length I mean unknown length. The word infinite was used to strenghten the point that the connection is usually never closed by the server. Not a whole lot of data is being transfered.Another Edit: Maybe it would help to point out that this is an HTTP server running a PHP script.
14058801	If you open a connection to the server, that check the server and use a while(server.isSending) { respond();} and then close the connection?Example:You would probably have to use an InputStream aswell.I´m not so familiar with working on InternetConnections, but I hope that you got on the right track
14058840	If they're simple commands separated by newlines, then it should be fairly simple to roll your own client:EDIT: HTTP isn't the optimal protocol for keeping a long-lived connection open and you might run into timeout issues. The code below is untested but should give you a good starting point.EDIT 2: As pointed out in the comments, the thread pool may or may not be necessary or useful here. You should note that using threads won't magically make things faster or increase the amount of requests you can handle. The benefit of using a thread pool is to allow the client to immediately receive new commands while a previous command is still executing. That might be important if processing the command requires some I/O task, e.g. calling out to another server, but in your situation it might be overkill.The key here is that the input stream returned from the socket remains open as long as the underlying TCP connection remains open. The client can just keep reading from the stream, and the readLine call will simply block as necessary until new data arrives. When readLine returns null, that means the underlying input stream encountered end-of-file, which in turn means that the server closed the socket.Once you have a full line of data, you can submit it to the thread pool to be parsed and executed in a different thread. Breaking the work up in this way allows you to focus on parsing and executing a command from a single line of text, which is much more manageable than trying to process an arbitrarily large stream of data.
14059446	It's a bit unclear, but I think that you want to check whether the deferred is resolved and add another callback if it's not:Essentially you can just checkto see whether another callback can be added.
14061689	I'm only just beginning my journey into Python. I want to build a little program that will calculate shim sizes for when I do the valve clearances on my motorbike. I will have a file that will have the target clearances, and I will query the user to enter the current shim sizes, and the current clearances. The program will then spit out the target shim size. Looks simple enough, I have built a spread-sheet that does it, but I want to learn python, and this seems like a simple enough project...Anyway, so far I have this:Now, I've got it reading the whole file, but how do I make it ONLY get the value on, for example, line 4. I've tried print f.readline(4) in the function, but that seems to just spit out the first four characters... What am I doing wrong?I'm brand new, please be easy on me!-d
14061726	To read all the lines:Then, to print line 4:Note that indices in python start at 0 so that is actually the fifth line in the file.
14061748	Not very efficient, but it should show you how it works. Basically it will keep a running counter on every line it reads. If the line is '4' then it will print it out.
14062571	I'm working on making pong in C#, and I've come across a problem. I have KeyPreview on, and here's my codeWhen I press any of the keys, nothing happens. The only time a keypress works is if it tests the condition for (char)Keys.Enter. Why is this? How can I make the form take KeyPress for keys other than enter?
14062631	Try overriding the KeyDown method instead:Also see What's the difference between KeyDown and KeyPress in .NET?
14062863	the KeyPress event works when the control has the focus.The keydown event allways works .=> intercept the keydown event
14063791	After I run this, I get a runtime error "double free or corruption". If I get rid of the destructor content (the delete) it works fine. What's wrong?
14063890	Let's talk about copying objects in C++.Test t;, calls the default constructor, which allocates a new array of integers. This is fine, and your expected behavior.Trouble comes when you push t into your queue using q.push(t). If you're familiar with Java, C#, or almost any other object-oriented language, you might expect the object you created earler to be added to the queue, but C++ doesn't work that way.When we take a look at std::queue::push method, we see that the element that gets added to the queue is "initialized to a copy of x." It's actually a brand new object that uses the copy constructor to duplicate every member of your original Test object to make a new Test.Your C++ compiler generates a copy constructor for you by default! That's pretty handy, but causes problems with pointer members. In your example, remember that int *myArray is just a memory address; when the value of myArray is copied from the old object to the new one, you'll now have two objects pointing to the same array in memory. This isn't intrinsically bad, but the destructor will then try to delete the same array twice, hence the "double free or corruption" runtime error.How do I fix it?The first step is to implement a copy constructor, which can safely copy the data from one object to another. For simplicity, it could look something like this:Now when you're copying Test objects, a new array will be allocated for the new object, and the values of the array will be copied as well.We're not completely out trouble yet, though. There's another method that the compiler generates for you that could lead to similar problems - assignment. The difference is that with assignment, we already have an existing object whose memory needs to be managed appropriately. Here's a basic assignment operator implementation:The important part here is that we're copying the data from the other array into this object's array, keeping each object's memory separate. We also have a check for self-assignment; otherwise, we'd be copying from ourselves to ourselves, which may throw an error (not sure what it's supposed to do). If we were deleting and allocating more memory, the self-assignment check prevents us from deleting memory from which we need to copy.
14063944	Um, shouldn't the destructor be calling delete, rather than delete[]?
14066069	You can find it in a single like below
14070442	The following script prints undefined to the console for each character in the string, but works correctly in Chrome.Do I have to do something to the array in order to get this to work properly in all browsers?
14070472	Older versions of IE don't support the array notation (string[x]) to access strings, use: charAt() instead.Also, if you're directly executing your function, you could as well create a self-executing anonymous function (to preserve the scope / not pollute the global namespace)Unless you have to run it from somewhere else also, of course.
14070511	It's console the problem here. This object does not exist in IE Javascript engine.If you do this it works in bothEDIT: console object does not exists until IE10 (as correctly noted by Cerbrus, unless you turn on the IE developer tool, in such case it exists also on IE8)[] to access strings chars can be used in IE8+ (on IE7 it does not work yet)
14070588	What bothers me the most is that when writing a new class/model, I always have to tell the model to take the input into their own property and I always have to pass parameters when calling a new class.So let's say you have two problems here:Repetition to define properties per each class definition.Passing parameters for each class creation.In the most bare and basic sense, you can not circumvent both. If you won't tell the class (at least somehow) which properties it represents, it wouldn't know. Somewhat similar for the second point, if the data is not set to the class, it won't work.So as it is technically not possible to prevent these two at all, the question is how to make it more comfortable and reduce repetition - if possible.One route to go would be to just take all these objects to be of the same type. I mean actually those are just some improved arrays, aren't they?So you can create yourself a base-class you can extend from that contains all the needed code, like importing an array, defining the properties.So you only need to write the code once and create as many objects and different "types" as you want.Some example, let's create one such object that has a base-class that does it's job:That's it.Object defined. Now let's use it:This does import some data from $_POST that is matching with the objects properties (similar to what you have). However the output is the same:You might now want that. So therefore you can create some decorators for example, here one that works with a callback function:Let's use it with the test-object from the previous example:And now this time the output is:Hope this is helpful. You can find the code here: Demo

14077371	Try this:You could add root-Element to make the input-data valid XML and uselibxml (DOM, simplexml, etc.). But the input data must be valid xmldata(your sample data looks valid, needs only root element). use strpos with &gt;&lt; as pattern and than substr. This is the faster wayUPDATE:here sample code using strpos and substr:

14086723	I must use a union containing a class pointer, but with ARC on, and as very well explained here: __unsafe_unretained NSString struct var you have to set the field __unsafe_unretained. That means, if I understand it well, you must manage yourself its lifecycle.For example:If I do something like:How do I release foo.__bar? Because with ARC I cannot call releaseor autorelease anymore?
14086780	The easiest way is to use a __bridge cast and CFRelease:Some other notes:Don't use the names __char, __array, and __bar. All identifiers that begin with two consecutive underscores are reserved by the C standard.You need to retain the object too, before the end of the statement that creates it, because at the end of that statement, ARC will release it. The easiest way to do that is by abusing CFBridgingRetain:You might be better off just turning FOO into an Objective-C class so that it can hold strong references.
14086817	I would hold an additional strong pointer to it, then you dont have to worry at all about releasing it.
14088822	I am building three php pages interlinking with each other for eg.1. Customer details2. product details3. payment detailssame procedure or mechanism that are provided at every on-line shopping websites.Now all I just need to pass or hold the data/values that are filled by any user at first form i.e. on customer profile page to second form i.e. on product details without submitting or inserting data into database, and the value of second page i.e. of product details with the data of first page should be pass to third page i.e on payment details, now while clicking on the submit button of third page the whole data or values of all three pages should be stored or inserted finally into database.I know php provides the method for this and I have used GET and POST method for this also but its is not at allHere is my code-For first page-
14088840	First of all please learn to format your question, it will really fetch you good answers, secondly for passing the data from page1 to page2 to page3 the best you can use to store the user's data is by using $_SESSION and later you can unset it after he is done with the form submission
14088873	You can do that by Temporarily inserting the data to the database and then removing it later.Its the most efficient way.Store it in a $_SESSION[] variable and access it throughout the session of the userThe most inefficient method will be to chain the data through the three web pages by using just the GET method and hiding the irrelevant data in &lt;input type='hiden' value='$val'&gt;Store them in files or cookies
14091293	I have a piece of code which by determining on wether an upload is successsful, cancelled or unsuccessful it displays the relevant messages:Now depending on the outcome of the upload I am trying to determine when each message should appear:Current code of the iframe load:Original code of the iframe load:What happended with the orignal code was that when a file uploaded succesfully, what happended was that a split second it displayed the success == 1 message but then straight away it displayed the cancel message which is success -- 2.This was obviously incorrect so to try to fix it, I tried the current code solution so that what I thought would happen is that if cancelled, display the success == 2 message, if file was successful, it displays the success == 1 message and that message did not change. The problem though is that the current code is providing a error below on this line while the orignal code never provided this error:The error displaying is: typeError: $(...).text(...).html is not a functionMy question is how can this error be fixed? I am assuming I need to change code in iframe load to prevent this.UPDATE:HTML:JQuery:PHP (uploads file server side):
14091475	If you mean what i understand, you want to insert msg into div as text, right?so you can use this code:
14091567	The problem is that your stopImageUpload is missing an argument. It's signature is this:but you call it like this:That means that you call htmlEncode(undefined) which leads to $('&lt;div&gt;').text(undefined).html()jQuery supports two function signatures for the text() function. When passed a string, it sets the content and then returns the jquery object for chaining, and when passed nothing (undefined), it returns a string. In this case since you are passing undefined it returns a string, and then you try to call html() on a string, which does not exist.UpdateOkay, so based on the code you posted, you should never be calling stopImageUpload with 1 ever. That is handled by the image-uploading PHP logic. As you have it now, you are calling it in the load callback of the iframe on cancel, which isn't right. That means when you click Cancel, it will cancel the upload by changing the iframe source to a cancelimage.php, and when that PHP runs, it will say the upload succeeded, which it did not. I actually think you can just remove that load callback entirely from the click handler.Update 2I think your problem is related to multiple presses of 'cancel'. Try this:Previously, any time you pressed cancel, you added a listener for 'load', but you never remove it, so even if, later on, you try to upload an image and it succeeds, the old listener would set it back to canceled. This new code will remove the listener after it fires, making that less likely.

14100757	Use Maven modules. There is extensive documentation here:
14101226	Simple and correctFirst of all, you can simplify your test case with a VALUES expression instead of the more verbose UNION ALL SELECT.You'd need explicit type casts in the first row, if data types are not the default integer and text ..Second, a FULL OUTER JOIN is utterly pointless. All it does is make your query slower. And if any row has more than one match in the other table, it gets multiplied in the count.Yields:which is wrong.Yields:which is correct, besides being simpler and faster.Admittedly, with row_number() freshly applied, there can be no dupes. But it's just a waste of time.PerformanceCounting is relatively slow for big tables. If you don't need an exact count but can live with an estimate, you can get this extremely fast:I quote the manual here: It is updated by VACUUM, ANALYZE, and a few DDL commands such as CREATE INDEX.More details in this related answer.
